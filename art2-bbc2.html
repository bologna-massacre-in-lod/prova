			<h2>As a photograph of a Sudanese protestor went viral, <span class="person">Sophia Smith Galer</span> discovers the age-old elements that give certain images mass appeal.</h2>
		</section>

		<p>What do you think of when you hear the word <q>icon</q>? <span class="person">Liz Hurley</span> in that Versace dress? <span class="person artist">David Bowie</span>? Or perhaps a 12th Century devotional image of a crucified <span class="person">Christ</span></p>

		<p>The truth is, all three of those examples – a famous photograph, a world-renowned musical artist and a piece of religious art – are icons. But the latter is the original; drawn from the Greek word eikōn, meaning <q>image</q> or <q>likeness</q>, these were portrait-style images of important figures like <span class="person">Christ</span>or the <span class="person">Virgin Mary</span> that first appeared in the early centuries of Christianity. Painted in an age when people were picture-poor, they weren't just pretty things to look at. These were didactic, powerful images that compelled you to pray and obey. Every possible feature – the use of colour, what the subject was holding, their posture – was of a semiotic importance that can be lost on us today in an age of mass media. </p>

		<p>But then an image like that of <span class="person">Alaa Salah</span>, protesting in <span class="place">Sudan</span>, captures the global imagination. Within a week of its publication, the image had already typified the entire Sudanese revolution and was being spray-painted on walls across the Arab world. Pull the image apart, and the iconographic details of age-old art are as present in this piece of smartphone photojournalism as they were centuries ago. How do you go about creating such an iconic image?</p>

		<h3>Break the mould</h3>

		<p>What is it about <span class="person">Alaa Salah</span> and this photograph that has made it so powerful? For Dr <span class="person">Julia Tatiana</span>, Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art at <span class="entity">National Gallery</span>,  <span class="place">Prague</span>, it is reminiscent of <span class="person artist">Jonathan Bachman</span>'s photograph of <span class="person">Ieshia Evans</span> at the Black Lives Matter protests in <span class="place">Baton Rouge</span>,  <span class="place">Louisiana</span>. <q>I think in our image-overloaded world we're struck by their authenticity, that they are spontaneous images that even so subscribe to visual themes we're now so used to seeing staged.</q></p>

		<p>Dr <span class="person">Tina Rivers Ryan</span>, an art historian and curator at the  <span class="entity">Albright-Knox Art Gallery</span> in  <span class="place">Buffalo</span>,  <span class="place">New York</span>, finds that the power lies in <span class="person">Salah</span>'s posture. <q>The upward thrust suggests a funnelling of energy to a single, concentrated point – an apt symbol for a revolution gaining focus and momentum, with <span class="person">Salah</span> as its metaphorical (and here, literal) centre.</q> It reminds <span class="person">Ryan</span> of the archetypal images of an orator from the classics with an open mouth and pointed finger, <q>while the hand on her stomach functions to ground her rhetoric as something heartfelt, or <q>coming from the gut.</q></q></p>

		<img src="imgs/art2-img2.jpg">

		<p>To a Western audience, it also possibly plays into – and against – stereotypes held about the status of women in the Arab world. <span class="person">Bailey</span> points out that, <q>the images of <span class="person">Salah</span> and <span class="person">Evans</span> also subscribe to the gender and racial politics of Western liberal societies, and the desire to see women of colour depicted in positions of power and respect, to retaliate against this long history of the iconisation of the rich, white man.</q> But it was ultimately the Sudanese people who shared the image online which brought it to attention in the first place; and a huge part of its resonance comes from its meaning to a person in <span class="place">Sudan</span> before its meaning to somebody alien to Sudanese culture.</p>

		<blockquote>There are so many symbols in this image that signify a new dawn for the youth in <span class="place">Sudan</span> it's dizzying</blockquote>

		<p><span class="person">Salah</span>'s power pose does recall classical orator stances as <span class="person">Ryan</span> suggests, but it's also typical of a <span class="person">Kandaka</span> – the name given to a queen in the ancient <span class="place">Kushite kingdom</span> of what's now most often known as <span class="place">Nubia</span> – and there are reliefs depicting these queens in similar poses from as far back as the 1st Century. This image is buying into a potent figure in Sudanese cultural identity, <span class="person">Salah</span>'s gold moon earrings add to this status as a regal, empowered feminine ideal.</p>

		<p>And it's not just <span class="person">Salah</span> that captures the viewer's attention; it's the sea of arms holding up their smartphones to film her singing. There are so many symbols in this image that signify a new dawn for the youth in <span class="place">Sudan</span> it's dizzying – and that's what has made it so evocative.</p>

		<h3>The right place and time</h3>

		<p>When <span class="person artist">Alberto Korda</span> took his Leica M2 to a memorial service one day in <time datetime="1960">1960</time> in <span class="place">Havana</span>, he knew he'd be taking pictures of some of the era's most important figures – <span class="person">Fidel Castro</span>, <span class="person">Che Guevara</span>; even <span class="person">Jean-Paul Sartre</span> and <span class="person">Simone de Beauvoir</span> were there. But he didn't quite know he'd take the photograph that would turn <span class="person">Guevara</span> into a world-renowned figure.</p>

		<img src="imgs/art2-img3.jpg">

		<p>The image that would come to be known as Guerrillero Heroico (Heroic Guerilla Fighter) began life as its larger, uncropped original; it included a palm tree on <span class="person">Guevara</span>'s left side and the profile of another man on his right. As this was a memorial service after an attack in <span class="place">Havana</span>, <span class="person">Guevara</span> was appropriately dressed in military attire, including his famous star beret. This photograph is so well-imprinted on our minds – and possibly on a poster in our teenage bedrooms – that it's easy to think <span class="person">Guevara</span> always wore that beret, but he didn't. So not only did <span class="person artist">Korda</span> have a perfect signifier of military prowess decorating his subject, but when he clicked on the flash button <span class="person">Guevara</span> was looking out into the crowd, preparing to give a speech. it's not the laughing, cigar-puffing guerrillero we see in other photos; this is a man with a searching, determined gaze.</p>

		<p>The image would not have the same power if it wasn't cropped, if <span class="person">Guevara</span> was looking into the lens or if he wasn't wearing the beret. It is a timeless image of hope, and combined with the beret it becomes a photographic promise of an eternal fight against capitalism.</p>

		<p>But interestingly it's not only this photograph that went on to iconicise <span class="person">Guevara</span>.</p>

		<h3>Alter the image to give it more meaning – and wait until your subject has died</h3>

		<p>If you don't know the famous portrait from <span class="person artist">Korda</span>'s photograph, you know it from Irish artist <span class="person artist">Jim Fitzpatrick</span>'s stylised <time datetime="1967">1967</time> poster version of the same image. Icons aren't necessarily photojournalistic; there is no pressure to make everything 100% factually correct, especially if it's an artist making the image rather than a journalist.</p>

		<figcaption>Irish artist <span class="person artist">Jim Fitzpatrick</span>'s stylised version of <span class="person artist">Korda</span>'s photograph helped seal its iconic status (Credit: <span class="entity">Alamy</span>)</figcaption>

		<p>Importantly, <span class="person artist">Fitzpatrick</span> created this only a short time after <span class="person">Guevara</span> died; he said, <q>I thought he was one of the greatest men who ever lived and I still do in many ways. And when he was murdered, I decided I wanted to do something about it, so I created the poster. I felt this image had to come out, or he would not be commemorated otherwise, he would go where heroes go, which is usually into anonymity.</q></p>

		<p>The use of red here is not accidental. Many critics have discussed the <q>Christification</q> of <span class="person">Che Guevara</span>; such a red colour is as evocative of communism as it is of the Passion, sacrifice and bloodshed. Even images of <span class="person">Guevara</span>'s post-mortem drew comparisons with images of <span class="person">Christ</span>'s frail body after the deposition from the cross. But unlike <span class="person artist">Korda</span>'s photograph, <span class="person artist">Fitzpatrick</span>'s icon was already an attempt to memorialise <span class="person">Guevara</span>.</p>

		<p>Similarly, <span class="person artist">Andy Warhol</span> made his iconic artworks of <span class="person">Marilyn Monroe</span> shortly after she died, adapting a publicity shot from one of her films. <span class="person artist">Coco Dávez</span>, a Spanish artist whose work focuses on creating Pop art-inspired modern icons, finds both these images powerful. Both transformed the subjects' status in her eyes. <q>It wasn't like <span class="person">Che Guevara</span> was irrelevant beforehand, but he became an icon through this image; in the case of <span class="person artist">Warhol</span>, and his <span class="person">Marilyn Monroe</span>, it's almost a meta-icon. She was already an icon and this image made her a super-icon.</q></p>

		<figcaption><span class="person artist">Warhol</span>'s <span class="artwork">Gold Marilyn</span> was one of several of the Hollywood star that he reproduced to create new iconic images (Credit: <span class="entity">Alamy</span>)</figcaption>

		<p><span class="person artist">Warhol</span> used the <span class="person">Marilyn</span> image in clever ways too, adapting it several times; in the famous diptych, the replication of her face evokes her celebrity and how mass-produced her appearance was all over the world. The colours are unrealistic, as is how 2D an image her face has become; she is distant, out of reach, no longer the human actress on posters everywhere but now a divine icon far beyond <span class="place">Hollywood</span>. Similarly, <span class="person artist">Warhol</span>'s <span class="artwork">Gold <span class="person">Marilyn Monroe</span></span> parodies her blonde hair and make-up, playing on the iconic signifiers with which the world associates her, but he surrounds her in gold like a <span class="artwork">Byzantine Madonna</span>.</p>

		<h3>Pick a subject who's already a hero</h3>

		<p>After seeing <span class="person">Marilyn Monroe</span> and <span class="person">Che Guevara</span>, it's difficult to look at <span class="person artist">Shepard Fairey</span>'s <span class="artwork">Hope</span> artwork of <span class="person">Obama</span> and not see striking parallels. It's almost a combination of the two images; the <span class="art-movement">Pop-art</span> engagement of <span class="person artist">Warhol</span> and the distant gaze of <span class="person artist">Korda</span>'s guerrillero. For <span class="person artist">Dávez</span>, icons have to be <q>characters that the world already have in their mind.</q></p>

		<img src="imgs/art2-img6.jpg">
		<figcaption><span class="person artist">Shepard Fairey</span>'s iconic image of <span class="person">Obama</span> recalls both <span class="person artist">Warhol</span>'s <span class="person">Marilyn</span> and <span class="person artist">Korda</span>'s Guevera (Credit: <span class="entity">Getty</span>)</figcaption>

		<p>It explains why this image of <span class="person">Obama</span> captured the American imagination. <q>An image already popular in politics is taken and his character is turned into a work of art,</q> <span class="person">Dávez</span> says.  It helped its passage from a press photograph to a poster that could be raised in rallies and put up on street walls. It recalls the colour scheme of the <span class="place">US</span> flag, or perhaps even the combination of Democrat and Republican colours; <span class="person">Ryan</span> says the image represents <q>the unification of the country through <span class="person">Obama</span>… Replacing his skin tones with blue, red, and white – the colours of the American flag – also downplays <span class="person">Obama</span>'s racial identity while affirming his patriotism, playing into the racist assumption that persons of colour are un-American.</q> Flat and without colour gradation, <span class="person artist">Fairey</span>'s icon is so reminiscent of <span class="art-movement">Pop art</span> that it counters <q>suspicions of <span class="person">Obama</span>'s <q>elitism</q> by associating him with popular, accessible imagery.</q></p>

		<p>Images of a leader can be difficult to get right, and such an iconic image may not have worked with a <span class="place">US</span> president who lacked <span class="person">Obama</span>'s character. For <span class="person">Bailey</span>, <q>Western audiences have become very cynical about seeing this image of the political leader in painting. You still see it in places like <span class="place">Syria</span> with portraits of <span class="person">Assad</span>, in <span class="place">North Korea</span> with <span class="person">Kim Jong-il</span>. But the recent mockery of <span class="person artist">Jon McNaughton</span>'s paintings of <span class="person">Donald Trump</span> shows how jarring and ridiculous these sort of paintings now appear to Western viewers. It's also hard not to be struck by how little self-awareness or irony that painter has shown in portraying <span class="person">Trump</span> in a style that is now predominantly associated with art produced under dictatorships.</q></p>

		<h3>The artist should respect the person they're picturing</h3>

		<p>You don't have to like somebody to respect them – or rather, you don't need your subject to much care for what you're doing with your camera or paintbrush to render them into an icon. <span class="entity">Winston Churchill</span> wasn't too pleased when photographer <span class="entity artist">Yousuf Karsh</span> tried in <time datetime="1941">1941</time> to take a picture of him; after politely asking <span class="entity">Churchill</span> to stop smoking, <span class="entity">Karsh</span> had to resort to plucking the cigar out of <span class="entity">Churchill</span>'s mouth in order to take the photograph. <span class="entity artist">Karsh</span> said <span class="entity">Churchill</span> looked <q>so belligerent he could have devoured me. It was at that instant that I took the photograph.</q> While not the most flattering image, his imperiousness helps make this a defining photograph.</p>

		<img src="imgs/art2-img7.jpg">

		<p>It's a complicated portrait for <span class="person">Dávez</span>, who points out that her icons always pay tribute to personal heroes. <q>When I used to work for the press and make portraits, of people I don't identify with, you're the person who helps tell the story. But when art is free in the sense that you paint what you want to paint, like I have done in Faceless, I choose. I choose people that I identify with.</q> <span class="person">Churchill</span> is somebody that she has personally never chosen to include in her iconographic images of Britons. But many do hold <span class="person">Churchill</span> up as an icon – and many would do this thinking of this photograph in particular.</p>

		<p>Back in the early ages of Christendom, the artists who painted icons would have been very religious, if not men of the cloth themselves. The making of an icon was considered prayer-like, as much of an homage to the subject as devotion would be to the finished piece; they certainly had a great deal of love for the characters from the <span class="work">Bible</span> that they were painting. <span class="person artist">Alberto Korda</span> was notably a communist who never asked for royalties for the use of his photograph of <span class="person">Che Guevara</span>, and <span class="person artist">Jim Fitzpatrick</span> also held <span class="person">Guevara</span> as a personal hero.</p>

		<p><q>In the future we will all be famous for 15 minutes</q>. <span class="person artist">Warhol</span>'s famous quote could suggest that his <span class="person artwork">Marilyn</span> artworks were tinged with cynicism rather than idealism. But his understanding and respect for how celestial a figure <span class="person">Monroe</span> had become is firmly present in his treatment of her image. Photographer <span class="person artist">Edward Steichen</span> said that <q>a portrait is not made in the camera but on either side of it.</q> Take the statement into the world of modern iconography – whether painted or photographed – and there is a truth that remains. Were it not for the unique personality of the subject or the talented iconographer who was there at the right time – these images would remain lost in today's deluge of visual jetsam.</p>
