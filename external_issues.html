		<h1>How art and culture can help us rethink time</h1>
		<img src="imgs/art1-img7.jpg">

		<h2>What do photographs of ancient organisms, blocks of ice in the centre of <span class="place">London</span> and the blockbuster Black Panther have to do with the future of humanity? <span class="person">Ella Saltmarshe</span> and <span class="person">Beatrice Pembroke</span> explain.</h2>
		</section>

		
		<p>There is a line in <span class="person">Hamlet</span> where the prince of <span class="place">Denmark</span> declares, <q>The time is out of joint.</q> <span class="person">Shakespeare</span> might have written these words yesterday, not more than 400 years ago, for we live in a world where our perception of time is dislocated. Humanity should be acting to preserve its long-term future. Instead, short-term mindsets and structures dominate. We focus on the present day while neglecting problems that will endure for centuries – from climate change to ecological collapse.</p>

		<p>For most of human history we haven’t needed to think long-term. It wasn’t very useful when we were avoiding attacks from sabre-toothed tigers, desperately foraging for breakfast on the forest floor and surviving extreme weather conditions. As futurist  <span class="person">Jamais Casio</span> puts it, <q>In a world of constant, imminent existential threats, the ability to recognise subtle, long-term processes and multi-generational changes wasn't a particularly important adaptive advantage.</q> Yet today, the nature of risk has changed. We no longer live in a world of clear, local cause and effect, and the greatest threats to civilisation are happening on the timescale of decades or centuries.</p>

		<p>To avoid these dangers, we can’t wait for our Neolithic mental functions to play evolutionary catch-up, so we need to supplement them. While our minds might be not be wired to deal with long-term threats and priorities in the abstract, they are wired for two things that we can control: story and emotion. Our predisposition towards story, and the deeply emotional nature of our decision-making, makes art and culture foundational to ensuring our future as a species.</p>

		<p>That’s why we have established an initiative called the <span class="event">Long Time Project</span>, which champions art and culture as a route to helping people think and act more long-term. This is about everything from the <span class="entity">YouTube</span> videos we watch, to the adverts we scroll past, to the box-sets we binge, to the art exhibitions we attend, to the theatre we see, to the clothes we wear and the furniture we use. All these art forms and creative works are shaped by small <q>c</q> culture: the collective values, norms and narratives that underpin and drive our societies. This culture shapes our collective direction of travel, from the kinds of laws we make, to the technology we develop, to the way we distribute wealth.</p>

		<blockquote> <q>Timefulness</q> is the ability to locate ourselves within eras and eons, rather than weeks and months </blockquote>

		<p>So, how exactly can art and culture in this broadest sense expand our perception of time and the future?</p>

		<p>Art can stretch our time frames, helping us develop what geologist <span class="person">Marcia Bjornerud</span> calls <q>timefulness</q>: the ability to locate ourselves within eras and aeons, rather than weeks and months.</p>

		<p>There is a growing body of deep time work that locates us in the epic geological history of the Universe, evoking awe and wonder. Photographer  <span class="person artist">Rachel Sussman</span>’s book <span class="work">The Oldest Living Things in the World</span> contains photographs of organisms more than 2,000 years old, like the Pando, a quaking aspen tree that has formed a forest-sized colony by cloning itself continuously for the past 80,000 years.</p>

		<img src="imgs/art1-img1.jpg">
		<figcaption>In her photographs, <span class="person artist">Rachel Sussman</span> captured organisms more than two millennia old (Credit: <span class="person">Rachel Sussman</span>)</figcaption>

		<p>As <span class="person">Sussman</span> said in an interview with the <span class="entity">Marina Abramovic Institute</span>: <q>My use of deep time is about creating perspective and differentiating between the shallowness of human timescales and the depth of natural, geologic, and cosmic timescales. It's really meant as a way of shifting our perspective… Somewhere along the way I came to the thought that every problem – personal, societal, anything – can benefit from long-term thinking. It’s a simple idea, but it asks you to slow down and consider long-term consequences before acting.</q></p>

		<blockquote>Every problem – personal, societal, anything – can benefit from long-term thinking</blockquote>
		<p><span class="person artist">Sussman</span> is not alone in her fascination with deep time. Artist-technologist <span class="person artist">Honor Harger</span> has created a soundscape of the history of the Universe that enables you to hear the <q>oldest song you’ll ever hear</q>: the sounds of the cosmic rays left over from the <span class="event">Big Bang</span>. In <time datetime="2014">2014</time>, the <span class="entity">National Academy of Sciences</span> in  <span class="place">Washington DC</span> hosted an exhibition called <span class="event">Imagining Deep Time</span>. And then there is the <span class="event">Deep Time walk</span>, an app produced by a scientist, a playwright and a sound designer that enables people to walk 4.6km through 4.6 billion years of history.  </p>

		<p>Other artists are stretching our time frames forwards, directly engaging with the far future. The <span class="entity">Long Now Foundation</span> is building a clock designed to run for 10 millennia inside a mountain in <span class="place">Texas</span> (<a href="">read more about the <span class="artwork">Clock of the Long Now</span></a>). And the <span class="event">Longplayer</span> project is a self-extending composition with Tibetan bowls designed by <span class="person artist">Jem Finer</span> which started on <time datetime="2000-01-01">1 Jan 2000</time> and will go on without repetition until <time datetime="2999">2999</time>.</p>

		<p>Meanwhile, in <time datetime="2014">2014</time>, artist <span class="person artist">Katie Paterson</span> created <span class="artwork">Future Library</span>, a forest planted in <span class="place">Norway</span> which will supply paper for a special anthology of books to be printed in 100 years’ time; <span class="person artist">Margaret Atwood</span> was the first author to hand over a manuscript that won’t be read for a century.</p>

		<p>All of these works stretch our perspectives, expand our time frames and help us relocate our existence in much more epic territory.</p>

		<img src="imgs/art1-img2.jpg">
		<figcaption><span class="person artist">Margaret Atwood</span> and <span class="person artist">Katie Paterson</span> collaborated to create a story for the <span class="artwork">Future Library</span> that will not be read for a century (Credit: <span class="person">Giorgia Polizzi</span>)</figcaption>

		<p>Speculative fiction is another way we can stretch our time frames through culture. From ancient Indian vedas to the medieval Christian obsession with apocalypse, from Twenty <span class="work">Thousand Leagues Under the Sea</span> to <span class="work">Blade Runner</span>, we’ve been pondering the future for thousands of years. Dystopian visions like <span class="work">The Handmaid’s Tale</span>, <span class="work">The Road</span>, or <span class="work">Children of Men</span> cause us to re-examine the elements of the present that might be taking us towards nightmare scenarios.</p>

		<p>Recently, designers and artists have sought to create visceral, immersive works that give people a more direct experience of the darker, more dystopian planet we might face if we don’t start thinking longer-term. In <time datetime="2017">2017</time>, the design studio <span class="entity">Superflux</span> created samples of what the polluted air of <time datetime="2030">2030</time> would smell like if nothing changed, and at a live event in the <span class="place">United Arab Emirates</span> invited policy-makers and senior politicians to inhale them. In the words of <span class="entity">Superflux</span> co-founder <span class="person">Anab Jain</span>, <q>Just one whiff of the noxious polluted air from <time datetime="2030">2030</time> brought home the point that no amount of data can.</q></p>

		<p>Another <span class="entity">Superflux</span> installation in <span class="place">Barcelona</span>, <span class="artwork">Mitigation of Shock</span>, transported people decades into the future into an apartment, set in <span class="place">London</span>, that has been drastically adapted for living with the consequences of climate catastrophe. In <span class="person">Jain</span>’s words: <q>We explored, designed and built an apartment located in a future no one wants, but that may be on the horizon. Not to scare, or overwhelm, but to help people critically reflect upon their actions in the present.</q></p>

		<img src="imgs/art1-img3.jpg">
		<figcaption><span class="entity">Superflux</span> installation <span class="artwork">Mitigation of Shock</span> allowed visitors to immerse themselves in life an apartment in a dystopian future (Credit: <span class="entity">Superflux</span>)</figcaption>

		<p>For more positive visions of the future, take a film like <span class="work">Black Panther</span>, which shows a thriving environmentally-friendly, technologically advanced African civilisation that has never been colonised. Building on the work of writers like <span class="person artist">Octavia Butler</span>, who placed people of colour at the heart of science fiction, the film enables us to explore a future that moves beyond present-day prejudices. As the second-highest grossing film of <time datetime="2018">2018</time> and the most tweeted about movie ever, this kind of speculative work clearly has the potential to influence our collective trajectory.</p>

		<p>On a much more local scale, projects like <span class="event">Forest of the Future</span> in <span class="place">London</span>’s <span class="place">Waltham Forest</span> features speculative art and design work about the borough, such as screen-prints of future local by-laws by designer <span class="person artist">Cat Drew</span>, to help decision-makers ­– politicians, citizens, consumers, voters, businesses – think about what a better future can look like, and how to achieve it.</p>

		<img src="imgs/art1-img4.jpg">
		<figcaption><span class="work">Black Panther</span> showed what a more positive future could look like (Credit: <span class="entity">Alamy</span>)<figcaption>

		<p>The genius of art and culture is that it allows us to experience ideas about the future on an emotional and embodied level, not just an intellectual one. Take <span class="person artist">Olafur Eliasson</span>’s recent <span class="artwork">Ice Watch</span>, in which he transported melting glacial ice from the <span class="place">Arctic</span> to <span class="place">London</span> where the public could see and touch the blocks. <q>I believe that one of the major responsibilities of artists – and the idea that artists have responsibilities may come as a surprise to some – is to help people not only get to know and understand something with their minds but also to feel it emotionally and physically,</q> <span class="person artist">Eliasson</span> wrote in a <time datetime="2016">2016</time> article for <span class="entity">Huffpost</span>.</p>

		<p>Often questions about the long-term future can feel distant and hard for people to translate into meaningful action in the context of their lives. It’s one thing to watch <span class="work">Black Panther</span> in the cinema, and another to know what its vision of the future means in the context of your own life. Art and culture can not only help us experience the long view, but can provide reflective space to enable us to take action based on that understanding.</p>

		<p><span class="entity">Somerset House</span>’s recent <span class="event">Earth Day season</span> exemplifies this approach with its focus on <q>the role of language and storytelling inpromoting collective action on the global climate crisis</q>. Its mixture of immersive installations, screenings, workshops and debates enabled the public to both explore and reflect. In the words of the founder of the <span class="entity">Climate Museum Bridget McKenzie</span>: <q>We need to move beyond seeing arts and culture in service to communication of climate action, to thinking of it as a transformative and generative agent.</q> </p>

		<img src="imgs/art1-img5.jpg">
		<figcaption> <span class="person artist">Olafur Eliasson</span> placed melting iceberg pieces in front of the <span class="place">Tate Modern</span> in <span class="place">London</span> (Credit: <span class="entity">Getty Images</span>)</figcaption>

		<p><span class="event">We Know Not What We May Be</span> was a project at the <span class="place">Barbican</span> in <span class="place">London</span> developed by <span class="person">Zoë Svendsen</span> of the arts organisation Metis. After a 20-minute talk from expert speakers from fields like economics, geography and environmental science, the public was invited to explore what it would be like to live in an alternative economic future, based on a fictional scenario devised from one of these experts’ research. In an immersive <q>factory of the future</q> they grappled with their role in the shape of the future through storytelling and experimentation. In the words of <span class="person">Svendsen</span>, the arts <q>can invite us to take on ways of operating without having to commit to them</q>.</p>

		<p>Or there’s the work of interactive theatre company <span class="entity">Coney</span>, whose <time datetime="2014">2014</time> piece <span class="artwork">Early Days (of a better nation)</span> involved no actors, only a participating audience who were told: <q>The war is over and the nation lies in ruins. You and your fellow survivors must build the beginnings of a new country. What are the rules you’re going to live by? And can you avoid the mistakes of the past?</q> The audience had to explore how they might organise themselves and run a country, testing and playing with new behaviours and scenarios.</p>

		<p>It’s likely that acting in the interests of the long term will involve radical change in the short term. It will involve rocking the boat, going against the norm, doing things very differently. Art and culture can help us do this in many ways: by connecting us with previous moments of change to make the radical feel more possible, by challenging the inevitability of the status quo, and by making radically different worlds feel tangible.</p>

		<p>Art and culture can remind us that radical change has happened in the past. It can both inspire us as to the scale of previous change and it can remind us of the values and behaviours needed to make change happen. For example, drama that retells previous movements of change like gay rights (<span class="work">Milk</span>), civil rights (<span class="work">12 Years a Slave</span>), or women’s rights (<span class="work">Suffragette</span>) can make us feel more courageous, willing to put more on the line and take action.</p>

		<blockquote>It can feel like the world we live in is the only option. Art and culture can expose us to a multiplicity of possible futures</blockquote>

		<p>Art can also help us challenge the status quo. Cultural theorist <span class="person">Mark Fisher</span> wrote of art’s role in challenging <q>the monopolisation of possible realities</q>. It can feel like the world we live in is the only option. Art and culture can expose us to a multiplicity of possible futures.</p>

		<p>Take <span class="work">Economic Science Fictions</span>, a new anthology exploring how science fiction can motivate new approaches to economics, or <span class="work">A People’s Future of the United States</span>, with speculative stories that challenge opppression and envision new futures for the <span class="place">US</span>. Speculative work can liberate us from the confines of pragmatism and to dream new futures. Fictions can fuel the future.</p>

		<p>Culture also has the power to rapidly transport us out of the confines of everyday life to create embodied experiencesof different possible futures. Back in the 1960s, the <span class="art-movement">Situationists</span>, a group of artists in <span class="place">Paris</span>, pioneered work that created moments to jolt people out of their usual ways of thinking and acting. They demonstrated that art and culture can create spaces that temporarily suspend the established order, norms, and privileges. This was a facet of the recent <span class="event">Extinction Rebellion</span> climate protests in the <span class="place">UK</span>, which used art and culture to transform the roads and bridges they occupied in central <span class="place">London</span>. The striking pink boat in <span class="place">Oxford Circus</span>, Samba bands, poetry, and impromptu performances from musicians all contributed to creating spaces that felt radically different from the norm.</p>

		<img src="imgs/art1-img7.jpg">
		<figcaption> <span class="person artist">Olafur Eliasson</span>’s the <span class="event">Weather Project</span> in the <span class="place">Tate Modern</span> prompted meetings, celebrations, relaxation, noisy acts of protest, and silent contemplation (Credit: <span class="entity">Getty Images</span>)</figcaption>

		<p>Ultimately, we believe that challenging short-termism will involve reauthoring some of the deeper narratives that animate our society, the collective beliefs that shape our direction of travel – from narratives about our place in the natural order of things to those which drive our economic paradigms. The stories we live in justify the status quo, make institutions feel inevitable, legitimise certain kinds of solutions, and make our world feel preordained. These cultural narratives are often foundational to the structures that incentivise short-termism, whether at the individual, political, corporate or financial level. For examples of this kind of narrative shift work, see recent work on poverty by the <span class="entity">Joseph Rowntree Foundation</span>, the oceans by the <span class="entity">Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation</span>, and <span class="entity">The Pop Culture Collaborative</span>, which is underpinned by the belief that <q>activists, artists, and philanthropists can encourage mass audiences to reckon with the past and rewrite the story of our nation’s future.</q></p>

		<p>Culture is foundational. It is the soil from which our civilisations grow. If we want to ensure that humans have a long, thriving future on this planet, then we need to work at the level of culture as well as politics, science, technology, finance and infrastructure. If we can work with art and culture to stretch our time frames so that we care about the long-term future, then hopefully as a species, we will have a future in the long term.</p>

			<h1>How to create an iconic image</h1>
			<img src="imgs/art2-img0.jpg">
			<p>By <span class="person">Sophia Smith Galer</span></p>
			<p class="publicationDate"><time datetime="2019-04-24">24th April 2019</time></p>
			<h2>As a photograph of a Sudanese protestor went viral, <span class="person">Sophia Smith Galer</span> discovers the age-old elements that give certain images mass appeal.</h2>
		</section>

		<p>What do you think of when you hear the word <q>icon</q>? <span class="person">Liz Hurley</span> in that Versace dress? <span class="person artist">David Bowie</span>? Or perhaps a 12th Century devotional image of a crucified <span class="person">Christ</span></p>

		<p>The truth is, all three of those examples – a famous photograph, a world-renowned musical artist and a piece of religious art – are icons. But the latter is the original; drawn from the Greek word eikōn, meaning <q>image</q> or <q>likeness</q>, these were portrait-style images of important figures like <span class="person">Christ</span>or the <span class="person">Virgin Mary</span> that first appeared in the early centuries of Christianity. Painted in an age when people were picture-poor, they weren't just pretty things to look at. These were didactic, powerful images that compelled you to pray and obey. Every possible feature – the use of colour, what the subject was holding, their posture – was of a semiotic importance that can be lost on us today in an age of mass media. </p>

		<img src="imgs/art2-img1.jpg">
		<figcaption>Religious icons drew their name from the Greek eikōn meaning <q>image</q> or <q>likeness</q> (Credit: Noah Seelam/AFP/<span class="entity">Getty Images</span>)</figcaption>

		<p>But then an image like that of <span class="person">Alaa Salah</span>, protesting in <span class="place">Sudan</span>, captures the global imagination. Within a week of its publication, the image had already typified the entire Sudanese revolution and was being spray-painted on walls across the Arab world. Pull the image apart, and the iconographic details of age-old art are as present in this piece of smartphone photojournalism as they were centuries ago. How do you go about creating such an iconic image?</p>

		<h3>Break the mould</h3>

		<p>What is it about <span class="person">Alaa Salah</span> and this photograph that has made it so powerful? For Dr <span class="person">Julia Tatiana</span>, Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art at <span class="entity">National Gallery</span>,  <span class="place">Prague</span>, it is reminiscent of <span class="person artist">Jonathan Bachman</span>'s photograph of <span class="person">Ieshia Evans</span> at the Black Lives Matter protests in <span class="place">Baton Rouge</span>,  <span class="place">Louisiana</span>. <q>I think in our image-overloaded world we're struck by their authenticity, that they are spontaneous images that even so subscribe to visual themes we're now so used to seeing staged.</q></p>

		<p>Dr <span class="person">Tina Rivers Ryan</span>, an art historian and curator at the  <span class="entity">Albright-Knox Art Gallery</span> in  <span class="place">Buffalo</span>,  <span class="place">New York</span>, finds that the power lies in <span class="person">Salah</span>'s posture. <q>The upward thrust suggests a funnelling of energy to a single, concentrated point – an apt symbol for a revolution gaining focus and momentum, with <span class="person">Salah</span> as its metaphorical (and here, literal) centre.</q> It reminds <span class="person">Ryan</span> of the archetypal images of an orator from the classics with an open mouth and pointed finger, <q>while the hand on her stomach functions to ground her rhetoric as something heartfelt, or <q>coming from the gut.</q></q></p>

		<img src="imgs/art2-img2.jpg">
		<figcaption>Within a week of the photograph going viral, images of <span class="person">Alaa Salah</span> sprung up on billboards and in murals (Credit: <span class="entity">Getty</span>)</figcaption>

		<p>To a Western audience, it also possibly plays into – and against – stereotypes held about the status of women in the Arab world. <span class="person">Bailey</span> points out that, <q>the images of <span class="person">Salah</span> and <span class="person">Evans</span> also subscribe to the gender and racial politics of Western liberal societies, and the desire to see women of colour depicted in positions of power and respect, to retaliate against this long history of the iconisation of the rich, white man.</q> But it was ultimately the Sudanese people who shared the image online which brought it to attention in the first place; and a huge part of its resonance comes from its meaning to a person in <span class="place">Sudan</span> before its meaning to somebody alien to Sudanese culture.</p>

		<blockquote>There are so many symbols in this image that signify a new dawn for the youth in <span class="place">Sudan</span> it's dizzying</blockquote>

		<p><span class="person">Salah</span>'s power pose does recall classical orator stances as <span class="person">Ryan</span> suggests, but it's also typical of a <span class="person">Kandaka</span> – the name given to a queen in the ancient <span class="place">Kushite kingdom</span> of what's now most often known as <span class="place">Nubia</span> – and there are reliefs depicting these queens in similar poses from as far back as the 1st Century. This image is buying into a potent figure in Sudanese cultural identity, <span class="person">Salah</span>'s gold moon earrings add to this status as a regal, empowered feminine ideal.</p>

		<p>And it's not just <span class="person">Salah</span> that captures the viewer's attention; it's the sea of arms holding up their smartphones to film her singing. There are so many symbols in this image that signify a new dawn for the youth in <span class="place">Sudan</span> it's dizzying – and that's what has made it so evocative.</p>

		<h3>The right place and time</h3>

		<p>When <span class="person artist">Alberto Korda</span> took his Leica M2 to a memorial service one day in <time datetime="1960">1960</time> in <span class="place">Havana</span>, he knew he'd be taking pictures of some of the era's most important figures – <span class="person">Fidel Castro</span>, <span class="person">Che Guevara</span>; even <span class="person">Jean-Paul Sartre</span> and <span class="person">Simone de Beauvoir</span> were there. But he didn't quite know he'd take the photograph that would turn <span class="person">Guevara</span> into a world-renowned figure.</p>

		<img src="imgs/art2-img3.jpg">
		<figcaption>Alberto <span class="person artist">Korda</span> is pictured with the uncropped and cropped versions of his photograph of <span class="person">Che Guevara</span> (Credit: <span class="entity">Alamy</span>)</figcaption>

		<p>The image that would come to be known as Guerrillero Heroico (Heroic Guerilla Fighter) began life as its larger, uncropped original; it included a palm tree on <span class="person">Guevara</span>'s left side and the profile of another man on his right. As this was a memorial service after an attack in <span class="place">Havana</span>, <span class="person">Guevara</span> was appropriately dressed in military attire, including his famous star beret. This photograph is so well-imprinted on our minds – and possibly on a poster in our teenage bedrooms – that it's easy to think <span class="person">Guevara</span> always wore that beret, but he didn't. So not only did <span class="person artist">Korda</span> have a perfect signifier of military prowess decorating his subject, but when he clicked on the flash button <span class="person">Guevara</span> was looking out into the crowd, preparing to give a speech. it's not the laughing, cigar-puffing guerrillero we see in other photos; this is a man with a searching, determined gaze.</p>

		<p>The image would not have the same power if it wasn't cropped, if <span class="person">Guevara</span> was looking into the lens or if he wasn't wearing the beret. It is a timeless image of hope, and combined with the beret it becomes a photographic promise of an eternal fight against capitalism.</p>

		<p>But interestingly it's not only this photograph that went on to iconicise <span class="person">Guevara</span>.</p>

		<h3>Alter the image to give it more meaning – and wait until your subject has died</h3>

		<p>If you don't know the famous portrait from <span class="person artist">Korda</span>'s photograph, you know it from Irish artist <span class="person artist">Jim Fitzpatrick</span>'s stylised <time datetime="1967">1967</time> poster version of the same image. Icons aren't necessarily photojournalistic; there is no pressure to make everything 100% factually correct, especially if it's an artist making the image rather than a journalist.</p>

		<p>Importantly, <span class="person artist">Fitzpatrick</span> created this only a short time after <span class="person">Guevara</span> died; he said, <q>I thought he was one of the greatest men who ever lived and I still do in many ways. And when he was murdered, I decided I wanted to do something about it, so I created the poster. I felt this image had to come out, or he would not be commemorated otherwise, he would go where heroes go, which is usually into anonymity.</q></p>

		<p>The use of red here is not accidental. Many critics have discussed the <q>Christification</q> of <span class="person">Che Guevara</span>; such a red colour is as evocative of communism as it is of the Passion, sacrifice and bloodshed. Even images of <span class="person">Guevara</span>'s post-mortem drew comparisons with images of <span class="person">Christ</span>'s frail body after the deposition from the cross. But unlike <span class="person artist">Korda</span>'s photograph, <span class="person artist">Fitzpatrick</span>'s icon was already an attempt to memorialise <span class="person">Guevara</span>.</p>

		<p>Similarly, <span class="person artist">Andy Warhol</span> made his iconic artworks of <span class="person">Marilyn Monroe</span> shortly after she died, adapting a publicity shot from one of her films. <span class="person artist">Coco Dávez</span>, a Spanish artist whose work focuses on creating Pop art-inspired modern icons, finds both these images powerful. Both transformed the subjects' status in her eyes. <q>It wasn't like <span class="person">Che Guevara</span> was irrelevant beforehand, but he became an icon through this image; in the case of <span class="person artist">Warhol</span>, and his <span class="person">Marilyn Monroe</span>, it's almost a meta-icon. She was already an icon and this image made her a super-icon.</q></p>

		<p><span class="person artist">Warhol</span> used the <span class="person">Marilyn</span> image in clever ways too, adapting it several times; in the famous diptych, the replication of her face evokes her celebrity and how mass-produced her appearance was all over the world. The colours are unrealistic, as is how 2D an image her face has become; she is distant, out of reach, no longer the human actress on posters everywhere but now a divine icon far beyond <span class="place">Hollywood</span>. Similarly, <span class="person artist">Warhol</span>'s <span class="artwork">Gold <span class="person">Marilyn Monroe</span></span> parodies her blonde hair and make-up, playing on the iconic signifiers with which the world associates her, but he surrounds her in gold like a <span class="artwork">Byzantine Madonna</span>.</p>

		<h3>Pick a subject who's already a hero</h3>

		<p>After seeing <span class="person">Marilyn Monroe</span> and <span class="person">Che Guevara</span>, it's difficult to look at <span class="person artist">Shepard Fairey</span>'s <span class="artwork">Hope</span> artwork of <span class="person">Obama</span> and not see striking parallels. It's almost a combination of the two images; the <span class="art-movement">Pop-art</span> engagement of <span class="person artist">Warhol</span> and the distant gaze of <span class="person artist">Korda</span>'s guerrillero. For <span class="person artist">Dávez</span>, icons have to be <q>characters that the world already have in their mind.</q></p>

		<p>It explains why this image of <span class="person">Obama</span> captured the American imagination. <q>An image already popular in politics is taken and his character is turned into a work of art,</q> <span class="person">Dávez</span> says.  It helped its passage from a press photograph to a poster that could be raised in rallies and put up on street walls. It recalls the colour scheme of the <span class="place">US</span> flag, or perhaps even the combination of Democrat and Republican colours; <span class="person">Ryan</span> says the image represents <q>the unification of the country through <span class="person">Obama</span>… Replacing his skin tones with blue, red, and white – the colours of the American flag – also downplays <span class="person">Obama</span>'s racial identity while affirming his patriotism, playing into the racist assumption that persons of colour are un-American.</q> Flat and without colour gradation, <span class="person artist">Fairey</span>'s icon is so reminiscent of <span class="art-movement">Pop art</span> that it counters <q>suspicions of <span class="person">Obama</span>'s <q>elitism</q> by associating him with popular, accessible imagery.</q></p>

		<p>Images of a leader can be difficult to get right, and such an iconic image may not have worked with a <span class="place">US</span> president who lacked <span class="person">Obama</span>'s character. For <span class="person">Bailey</span>, <q>Western audiences have become very cynical about seeing this image of the political leader in painting. You still see it in places like <span class="place">Syria</span> with portraits of <span class="person">Assad</span>, in <span class="place">North Korea</span> with <span class="person">Kim Jong-il</span>. But the recent mockery of <span class="person artist">Jon McNaughton</span>'s paintings of <span class="person">Donald Trump</span> shows how jarring and ridiculous these sort of paintings now appear to Western viewers. It's also hard not to be struck by how little self-awareness or irony that painter has shown in portraying <span class="person">Trump</span> in a style that is now predominantly associated with art produced under dictatorships.</q></p>

		<h3>The artist should respect the person they're picturing</h3>

		<p>You don't have to like somebody to respect them – or rather, you don't need your subject to much care for what you're doing with your camera or paintbrush to render them into an icon. <span class="entity">Winston Churchill</span> wasn't too pleased when photographer <span class="entity artist">YousefKarsh</span> tried in <time datetime="1941">1941</time> to take a picture of him; after politely asking <span class="entity">Churchill</span> to stop smoking, <span class="entity">Karsh</span> had to resort to plucking the cigar out of <span class="entity">Churchill</span>'s mouth in order to take the photograph. <span class="entity artist">Karsh</span> said <span class="entity">Churchill</span> looked <q>so belligerent he could have devoured me. It was at that instant that I took the photograph.</q> While not the most flattering image, his imperiousness helps make this a defining photograph.</p>

		<p>It's a complicated portrait for <span class="person">Dávez</span>, who points out that her icons always pay tribute to personal heroes. <q>When I used to work for the press and make portraits, of people I don't identify with, you're the person who helps tell the story. But when art is free in the sense that you paint what you want to paint, like I have done in Faceless, I choose. I choose people that I identify with.</q> <span class="person">Churchill</span> is somebody that she has personally never chosen to include in her iconographic images of Britons. But many do hold <span class="person">Churchill</span> up as an icon – and many would do this thinking of this photograph in particular.</p>

		<p>Back in the early ages of Christendom, the artists who painted icons would have been very religious, if not men of the cloth themselves. The making of an icon was considered prayer-like, as much of an homage to the subject as devotion would be to the finished piece; they certainly had a great deal of love for the characters from the <span class="work">Bible</span> that they were painting. <span class="person artist">Alberto Korda</span> was notably a communist who never asked for royalties for the use of his photograph of <span class="person">Che Guevara</span>, and <span class="person artist">Jim Fitzpatrick</span> also held <span class="person">Guevara</span> as a personal hero.</p>

		<p><q>In the future we will all be famous for 15 minutes</q>. <span class="person artist">Warhol</span>'s famous quote could suggest that his <span class="person artwork">Marilyn</span> artworks were tinged with cynicism rather than idealism. But his understanding and respect for how celestial a figure <span class="person">Monroe</span> had become is firmly present in his treatment of her image. Photographer <span class="person artist">Edward Steichen</span> said that <q>a portrait is not made in the camera but on either side of it.</q> Take the statement into the world of modern iconography – whether painted or photographed – and there is a truth that remains. Were it not for the unique personality of the subject or the talented iconographer who was there at the right time – these images would remain lost in today's deluge of visual jetsam.</p>
