		<section id="Introduction">
			<p>Since the viral outbreak of COVID-19 in <span class="place">China</span> in <time datetime="2020-01">January</time>, the art world has come to a sudden halt. With major museums, fairs, and galleries canceling events and exhibitions all over the world, the industry as a whole is experiencing the strain of the global pandemic. However, it is easy to forget how the gallery ecosystem in <span class="place">China</span> felt the first, immediate impacts of COVID-19.</p>
			<p><span class="entity">Art Basel</span> in <span class="place">Hong Kong</span>, arguably the biggest art world event in <span class="place">Asia</span>, was set to open to VIPs on <time datetime="2020-03-18">March 18th</time>. When the fair was canceled early last month, it was the first major industry event to be stricken from the calendar &#8212; sending reverberations through the country and the art market at large.</p>
			<span class="entity">Artsy</span> spoke to over 20 galleries in order to examine how the gallery ecosystem has been altered by COVID-19 and how many dealers are coping with the impact the virus has made on the art industry in <span class="place">China</span>.</p>

			<h2>The cancellation of <span class="entity">Art Basel</span> in <span class="place">Hong Kong</span></h2>

			<p>On <time datetime="2020-01-16">January 16th</time>, 24 galleries &#8212; including <span class="entity">Lévy Gorvy</span>, <span class="entity">Lisson Gallery</span>, and <span class="entity">Sprüth Magers</span> &#8212; co-signed a letter that petitioned <span class="entity">Art Basel</span> in <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> to take into account the impact the city’s months-long pro-democracy protests were having on market confidence. Hong Kong’s economy went into a recession last fall tied to the ongoing protests, and in <time datetime="2019-10">October 2019</time>, the <span class="event">Asia Contemporary Art Show</span> canceled its spring 2020 edition due to a decline in attendance and sales at its fall edition. The 24 galleries wanted <span class="entity">Art Basel</span> to make concessions on costs for participating exhibitors. At around the same time, a dozen galleries decided to pull out of the fair entirely, as the spread of COVID-19 became a global concern.</p>
			<p>After the virus was first identified in the beginning of 2020, reports of cases in <span class="place">China</span>, throughout <span class="place">Asia</span>, and then <span class="place">Europe</span> and the <span class="place">United States</span> began to increase. On <time datetime="2020-01-23">January 23rd</time>, the entire Chinese city of <span class="place">Wuhan</span> was placed under lockdown, and <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> confirmed its first COVID-19 case. Mass protest activities in <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> have been suspended ever since.</p>

			</figure>		

			<p>Between news of COVID-19 and lingering distress from the protests, the majority of those petitioning the fair to cancel were Western galleries. For international galleries with multiple spaces around the world, <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> makes up a small piece of their business. The prospect of showing at a fair with a lowered turnout of collectors was clearly a losing venture for dealers. Faced with a choice, those galleries would have rather eaten the sunk cost and turned their attention towards other markets.</p>
			<p>But for many regional galleries, <span class="entity">Art Basel</span> in <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> is the most important fair of the year. The cancellation always had the potential to affect local <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> galleries the most, which explains why in the midst of demands to cancel, some local galleries called for the fair to go on. On <time datetime="2020-01-31">January 31st</time>, the board of the <span class="entity">Hong Kong Art Gallery Association</span>, whose members consist of over 40 local and international galleries, released an open letter that expressed how the situation in <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> had been misrepresented to galleries overseas and urged the organizers to consider input from participants other than international galleries.</p>			

			<blockquote>Of course, we can anticipate some effects on the art market, but like SARS in <time datetime="2003">2003</time>, we are confident <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> will bounce back and remain the leading arts hub in <span class="place">Asia</span>.</blockquote>

			<p>However, at the end of the day, COVID-19 presented a public health crisis that concerned not only those in <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> and <span class="place">China</span>, but internationally, as well. Regardless of the specific reasons that eventually drove the actual cancellation, on <time datetime="2020-02-06">February 6th</time>, <span class="entity">Art Basel</span> announced that the <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> fair would be canceled.</p>
			<p><span class="person">Wei-Wei Wang</span>, the <span class="place">Asia</span> representative for the <span class="place">Zurich</span>-based gallery <span class="entity">Mai 36 Galerie</span>, understood why the fair had to be canceled. <q>As a gallery that has been participating in <span class="entity">Art Basel</span> in <span class="place">Basel</span> for 30 years, we encountered a similar situation in the ’90s during the <span class="event">Gulf War</span>,</q> she said. <q>At the time, the whole show was deserted and there were very few visitors. In the end, [<span class="entity">Art Basel</span> didn’t] have a choice, and we support their decision.</q></p>

			<p>Beyond <span class="entity">Art Basel</span> in <span class="place">Hong Kong</span>, a series of additional large-scale events during the city’s major art season in <time datetime="2020-03">March</time> were also canceled or postponed: <span class="event">Art Central</span>, <span class="event">Hong Kong Arts Festival</span>, museum exhibitions, and a slate of music and dance concerts featuring both local and international performers.</p>
			<p>Despite those cancellations, a cluster of galleries in the <span class="place">Wong Chuk Hang</span> area of the city, such as <span class="entity">Axel Vervoordt Gallery</span>, <span class="entity">Rossi & Rossi</span>, <span class="entity">Pekin Fine Arts</span>, and <span class="entity">Blindspot Gallery</span>, united in solidarity to open their new shows on <time datetime="2020-02-15">February 15th</time>.</p>

			<p><q>During the hardships and challenges like this, it’s great to see the solidarity of the community here,</q> said <span class="person">Boris Vervoordt</span>, founder and director of <span class="entity">Axel Vervoordt Gallery</span>. The gallery also has a space in <span class="place">Antwerp</span>.</p>
			<p>Moreover, almost 70 <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> art and culture organizations&#8212;galleries, museums, auction houses, and universities&#8212;have joined forces to launch the nonprofit <span class="entity">ART Power HK</span>, an online platform to showcase events and exhibitions that were planned for <time datetime="2020-03">this month</time>. The <span class="entity">Asia Society</span> and the <span class="entity">Hong Kong Art Gallery Association</span> have also partnered to put on a month-long sculpture exhibition that is set to open on <time datetime="2020-03-26">March 26th</time>. The exhibition will include works from 21 local and international galleries.</p>
			<p>But the epidemic’s impact on galleries will extend well beyond <time datetime="2020-03">March</time> and <time datetime="2020-04">April</time>. The <span class="entity">Fine Arts Literature Art Center</span>, located in <span class="place">Wuhan</span> at the center of the pandemic, delayed its planned gallery opening and made adjustments to its exhibition programming for the first half of <time datetime="2020">2020</time>.</p>

			<p>As the world’s priority has become combatting the virus &#8212; with entire countries, like <span class="place">Italy</span>, and cities, like <span class="place">Wuhan</span>, remaining under lockdown &#8212; it seems increasingly impossible for society to resume business as usual in the coming months.</p>
			<p><q>A lot of us in the local <span class="place">Wuhan</span> art circle have been working hard at things like transporting supplies to hospitals or fundraising donations through charity auctions,</q> said <span class="person">Liu Ming</span>, founder and director of the <span class="entity">Fine Arts Literature Art Center</span>.</p>
			
			<blockquote><q>During the hardships and challenges like this, it’s great to see the solidarity of the community here.</q></blockquote>

			<p>Because of the pandemic, the center has shifted the priorities of its gallery accordingly. <q>Since its founding, <span class="entity">Fine Arts Literature Art Center</span> has been juggling media and nonprofit projects,</q> said <span class="person">Ming</span>. <q>We have a large collection of books, documents, and materials in our warehouse and archives. During this time, we will concentrate on organizing and researching these materials, as well as planning online activities.</q></p>
			<p>All galleries in mainland <span class="place">China</span> and <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> have been set back in one way or another, which has made many in the industry anxious. <q>We are all in a state of feeling tense,</q> said <span class="person">Chao Lu</span>, director at the <span class="place">Beijing</span> location of <span class="entity">Chambers Fine Art</span>. As public events have been canceled and regular business activities have come to a standstill in <span class="place">Beijing</span>, the gallery might focus on its presence in other markets.</p>

			<p><span class="entity">Galleria Continua</span>, which recently opened its fifth location in <span class="place">Rome</span> in addition to spaces in <span class="place">San Gimignano</span>, <span class="place">Beijing</span>, <span class="place">Moulins</span>, and <span class="place">Havana</span>, has also felt the virus’s impact on its business. <q>The biggest impact [is that] it reduced contact and interaction within the industry,</q> said <span class="person">Jinle Shi</span>, <span class="entity">Galleria Continua</span>’s <span class="place">Beijing</span> sales manager. <q>For galleries, the direct loss is the loss of connections to clients.</q></p>

			<p><span class="person">David Tung</span>, a director at <span class="entity">Lisson Gallery</span>, said that at the moment, the priority at its <span class="place">Shanghai</span> space is to ensure <q>the safety of our staff and artists, as well as our customers and audience,</q> and to <q>follow the protocols set out by the national and local government and work to defeat this virus.</q></p>
			<p>At the same time, he keeps his clients abreast of the gallery’s updates through the internet. <q>The <span class="place">Shanghai</span> space’s purpose is to better serve our mainland <span class="place">China</span> customers and to take <span class="place">Shanghai</span> as the center, extending to other parts of <span class="place">Asia</span>,</q> <span class="person">Tung</span> said. <q>For us, the function of the <span class="place">Shanghai</span> space during this period remains exactly the same and even allows us to provide better service for our clients.</q></p>

			<blockquote><q>A lot of us in the local <span class="place">Wuhan</span> art circle have been working hard at things like transporting supplies to hospitals or fundraising donations through charity auctions.</q></blockquote>


			<p>International galleries without a physical space in <span class="place">Asia</span>, but which have representatives on the ground, confront their own set of challenges. Sales at these galleries &#8212; such as <span class="entity">Mai 36</span>, <span class="entity">Salon 94</span>, <span class="entity">Pilar Corrias</span>, and <span class="entity">David Kordansky</span>, among others &#8212; rely overwhelmingly on their participation in regional fairs such as <span class="entity">Art Basel</span> in <span class="place">Hong Kong</span>.</p>
			<p><q><span class="event">Art Basel</span> <span class="place">Hong Kong</span>, <span class="event">Gallery Weekend</span> <span class="place">Beijing</span>, and <span class="event">West Bund</span> <span class="place">Shanghai</span> are the few shows where <span class="entity">Mai 36</span> exhibits our artists’ works in <span class="place">Asia</span>,</q> Wei-Wei Wang said. <q><span class="entity">Mai 36</span> has also initiated the exchange program between <span class="event">Gallery Weekend</span> <span class="place">Beijing</span> and <span class="place">Zurich</span> <span class="event">Gallery Weekend</span>. Before the opening of our permanent space, these shows are very important showcase platforms for us.</q></p>
			<p>For the rest of the first half of <time datetime="2020">2020</time>, the gallery will focus its energy on shows outside of <span class="place">Asia</span> that will go on as planned. It has no other plans to show in <span class="place">Asia</span> since <span class="entity">Art Basel</span> in <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> was canceled.</p>

			</figure>
			
			<p>The epidemic has increased the strain on galleries that have felt the effects of a slowing brick-and-mortar economy. Whether or not it is part of their active strategy, galleries must now devote more energy to their digital platforms.</p>
			<p>The powerhouses have already been focused on online strategy. <span class="entity">Gagosian</span> started making digital sales at the end of <time datetime="2018">2018</time>, with an online showroom that operates alongside the gallery’s presence at annual art fairs. Despite the temporary closing of its <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> space, <span class="entity">Gagosian</span> has increased promoting buying and selling online through frequent updates on its <span class="social-network">WeChat</span> account and other social media platforms.</p>
			<p>On <time datetime="2020-02-11">February 11th</time>, <span class="entity">Hauser & Wirth</span> announced on its <span class="social-network">WeChat</span> channel that the gallery’s <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> space would postpone its <time datetime="2020-03">March</time> exhibition, while opening a brand-new online viewing room in the meantime. The online viewing room would present past exhibitions at its <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> space and new commissions by its artists.</p>

			<blockquote>To keep up with the rapid market changes in this new decade, galleries can no longer solely depend on physical showrooms and art fairs for sales.</blockquote>

			<p>Even though <span class="entity">Art Basel</span> in <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> will not physically take place this year, the fair and its participating galleries have moved online as well. Last week, <span class="entity">Art Basel</span> announced the galleries who will be showcasing works through its new viewing rooms digital initiative, including local dealers like <span class="entity">10 Chancery Lane</span>. <span class="entity">Art Central</span>, too, is bringing sales online for its participating galleries. (Full disclosure: <span class="entity">Artsy</span> is partnering with <span class="entity">Art Central</span> and will be serving as the platform for its online sales.)</p>
			<p>More galleries will utilize third-party online art sales platforms (including those such as <span class="entity">Artsy</span>) to reach a wider community of collectors. It goes without saying that there are advantages to a gallery space in real life, but to keep up with the rapid market changes in this new decade, galleries can no longer solely depend on physical showrooms and art fairs for sales. Unlike physical galleries, buying and selling art online is not bound by geography, and it can happen around the clock.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, it is impossible for the virtual to truly replace the brick-and-mortar experience. Many in the industry are trying to strike a balance between the two. <q>Buying and selling online is definitely a trend, but the physical gallery can’t be replaced, because art itself requires a certain intimacy and looking up close,</q> <span class="person">Ming Liu</span> said. <q>But we do have collaborations and experiments on the online front.</q></p>

			</figure>
			
			<p><span class="person">Chao Lu</span> echoed that sentiment. <q>Even though the art market is putting more and more emphasis on regional fairs, the physical galleries in mainland <span class="place">China</span>, big or small, are still integral,</q> he said. <q>Combining online and offline sales may be the most practical approach to the business. Most clients still prefer to see the works for themselves, even if they are already familiar with the artists’ history and past works.</q></p>
			<p><span class="person">Emerald Mou</span> from <span class="place">Hong Kong</span>–based gallery <span class="entity">Mine Project</span> said, <q>We are passionate about any channels that could help promote young artists. Many of the artists we work with are exploring the internet and how the internet affects our contemporary world, so naturally, the gallery cares about and is active in fields that relate to the internet, whether they are directly connected to digital sales or not.</q></p>
			<p>There have been more than a few enterprises that are trying to capture a piece of the digital art sales market, but the challenges of popularizing art collecting, building platform users, and cultivating online collecting habits might be more difficult to solve than the technology alone.</p>

			<h2>The outlook for the Chinese market</h2>

			</figure>

			<p>While no one has the answer, the question on everyone’s mind in the art world remains: When will the market recover from the effects of COVID-19?</p>
			<p>Of course, it depends on how quickly the pandemic will be contained, and despite the industry’s optimism about the speed of return to normalcy in society, it will take a lot more time for the market to bounce back.</p>
			<p><q>I have confidence that the Chinese government and global efforts will quell the disease, but the repercussions of this will last at least till the fall,</q> said <span class="person">Mathieu Borysevicz</span>, founder and director of <span class="place">Shanghai</span>-based gallery <span class="entity">Bank</span>. <q>The Chinese art market was already sluggish the past two years. This outbreak will only adversely affect anyone doing business in or with <span class="place">China</span> and subsequently the art market. The art market only flourishes when the economy at large does. I think it’ll take at least half a year to recover.</q></p>
			<p>Others are more optimistic, such as <span class="person">Dominique de Villepin</span> and <span class="person">Arthur de Villepin</span>. The two are planning to open their first space in <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> on <time datetime="2020-03-20">March 20th</time>, even amidst the fear and concerns over COVID-19. <q>Over the past several months, <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> has experienced significant political upheaval and is now faced with a serious global health concern,<q> the <span class="person">de Villepins</span> told <span class="entity">Artsy</span>. "Of course, we can anticipate some effects on the art market, but like SARS in <time datetime="2003">2003</time>, we are confident <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> will bounce back and remain the leading arts hub in <span class="place">Asia</span>."</p>

			<p><q>It’s not only the art industry, but our entire society is facing an enormous challenge. The global economy will most likely be affected and it is still early for us to predict its consequences,</q> <span class="person">Wang</span> said. <q>In the face of a matter of life and death, many artists are also reflecting deeper on the question of existence. These are the invisible but positive aspects of what is happening right now.</q></p>
			<p>While the <q>live</q> aspect of art has been interrupted, most would agree that it is an opportunity to reflect on the present and the future of the industry.</p>
			<p><q>While large-scale events do bring attention and large audiences, the focus on these over the past few years had taken us further away from the essence of art,</q> <span class="person">David Tung</span> said. <q>In this sense, I don’t take slowdown in large-scale events as a negative... It is actually an opportunity for us to quietly think about the future development of the art industry in <span class="place">China</span>.</q></p>

		-->

		<section>
			<p>As the pandemic wears on, people around the world continue to live in self-isolation or under strict lockdown measures -- this includes many members of the international artist community.</p>

			<p>While working alone may suit some creatives just fine, others feed off intimate interaction and visual stimulus from beyond their immediate world.</p>

			<p>In the absence of physical human connection and with movement drastically limited, many artists have had to turn inwards for inspiration. Whether that means reaching into the back catalogs of their memories, or creating new and entirely imagined worlds and landscapes, the creative response to the coronavirus crisis has been extraordinary.</p>

			<p>With that in mind, CNN asked 9 artists living in cities around the world to create an original artwork that reflects the times we are living in today. Scroll on to see the results and read about their personal experiences.</p>

			<blockquote><q>Staying in and getting lost in making art is pure bliss.</q><br><p class="quoteAuthor"><span class="person artist">Gary Taxali</span></p></blockquote>

			<p>The pandemic has forced everyone into a state of introspection due to isolating, whether welcomed or not. As an artist, it's not the worst place to be because that happens automatically when I create work. Staying in and getting lost in making art is pure bliss. Nothing is better. The unease derives from losing the ability to take daily breaks and observe and interact with the world. The myriad of little things on the outside serve as much needed creative catalysts for my art. A funny and bizarre overheard conversation, an oddly beautiful hand-painted sign on a building, a rebellious flower busting through the pavement -- the list of inspiration is endless. The only thing I have to go on right now are memories of these experiences. Yet it's wondrous to have a heightened appreciation of everything out there, and for that, I relish in gratitude.</p>

			<blockquote><q>This has been a period of self-reflection -- to try and understand what kind of world I'd like to live in.</q><br><p class="quoteAuthor"><span class="person artist">Anthony Muisyo</span></p></blockquote>

			<p>Vurugu is a <span class="place">Swahili</span> word that loosely translates to chaos -- chaos defined by the unprecedented threat humanity faces in the form of the Covid-19 pandemic. This unusual period has been marked by a sharp spike in mentions of anxiety all around us. I believe this is a feeling that is shared across the general population right now and one I tried to capture with this piece. Working on this piece offered me a chance to be introspective and question all these fragile systems that society is currently built upon. It gave me yet another chance to acknowledge my privilege and to do better in helping to build a more inclusive society in whatever way.</p>
			<p>This particular piece employs both dark and solemn colors as well as shades that contrast this. Over time, I have been able to better understand the role color plays in conveying emotions and in this particular case, color works to bring out the duality of a dark reality and that of a hopeful future, a future borne out of this downtime everyone has been forced into -- a future that prioritizes humanity.</p>
			<p>This has been a period of self-reflection -- to try and understand what kind of world I'd like to live in, to deeply value and treasure the already beautiful and meaningful connections I have managed to build with people I care for and finally, to always hope.</p>

			<p>Without a doubt, what is happening has been a new process for me. Although I have been working alone for several years from my workshop at home, I have always needed social interaction with my close ones to feed on experiences, knowledge, love.</p>
			<p>My work allows me to produce remotely. Each project in which I am a part, is born and develops at great distances and in different countries. So digital communication is something I've always used.</p>
			<p>The piece I made is a portrait of my last weeks and how social networks have become our best tool for me and my close ones, to nourish ourselves with ideas, inspiration and above all, feel others a little closer.</p>

			<p>Happiness is being proud of what you do every day. These days I have taken a step back, stopped reacting and reconnected. By recalibrating towards the simple positives, I am centered in who I am, on my own, alone. I have the power, it all depends on me, creativity is within me. No travels, hosting people over diner, or dance classes required. All I need is to look out the window to stimulate MY creativity. Just me, the little details of my confined life and my art.</p>

			<p>The picture is inspired by my daily commute to work during the pandemic. Matatus and boda bodas (public minibuses and motorcycle taxis) are an essential part of transportation for the majority of Kenyans. The Government's measures of controlling the spread of the disease include the reduction of the amount of passengers in matatus. Matatu operators are also required to provide sanitizers or disinfectants to passengers as they board the matatus. Passengers on the other hand, have to wear masks to avoid catching or spreading the virus. We're all in this together. We're all going through the same thing. We really need to protect ourselves and the other people around us.</p>

			<p>I am extremely lucky that I am at home with my husband and a couple of friends along with their three year old. My friends recently moved here and were in search of an apartment when the lockdown suddenly started and ended up living with us.</p>
			<p>We have begun to live like a joint family, cooking meals together, dividing chores and taking care of the child and each other. We have divided the house into office area and play area where all of us disperse to after breakfast only to reconvene at dinner post work. While we miss our actual families and can see them only via video calls, this co-living situation has kept us sane in these unprecedented times.</p>

			<p>In <span class="place">Singapore</span>, life is temporarily on hold to contain the spread of the virus. Businesses are closed, roads are empty and the hustle and bustle of city life is no more. However, the community feels more connected than ever with everyone looking out for each other. Volunteer groups who host health checkups, community-led food donation drives, businesses who produce masks to be given away, people who donate their skills through streaming classes so that those at home can retain a sense of normalcy -- this difficult time shines light on the good in people. At the end of the day, we are all small pieces of a puzzle set trying our best to paint the big picture.</p>

			<p>I'm lucky to have a creative outlet to occupy my mind and provide distraction from the global anxiety and speculation of this distressing time. It was strange to have a digital opening of my new exhibition, <cite>In Bloom</cite>, devoid of the social gathering and congratulations that a traditional opening satisfies. Having to adjust has been difficult. However, I have found sanctuary in the act of making. The escapism of creating helps stabilize and relax me because the action is so moment to moment.</p>

			<blockquote><q>It would be wonderful if the world slowed down a bit after this.</q><br><p class="quoteAuthor"><span class="person artist">Wilfrid Wood</span></p></blockquote>

			<p>I've sculpted a self-portrait, as if I've just got up -- hair tousled with a receding hairline, red nose, wrinkles, my melting face feeling the effects of gravity. It's made from Plasticine after its been in the oven for a few minutes when its nice and warm and squidgy. You get accidental smears and dents all over the surface. It's a lovely simple material to use, the colors are soft, its immediate and quick... the only thing is, it doesn't last. The portrait will gradually warp and fall apart, as will I. It's an interesting task to really look at yourself, and of course there's a centuries old tradition of artists doing self portraits. I've tried to confront myself without vanity, but also not making myself look like a total tramp out of a sort of self-deprecation.</p>
			<p>I find social distancing pretty sad. I'm longing to spend an evening with friends, or go to the <span class="place">West End</span> on a packed bus. As an artist, people are my subject and fascination. I don't want art to be only seen online. My work, most artists work, is a physical thing, especially sculpture. So I want to have shows, go to parties, draw strangers.</p>
			<p>It would be wonderful if the world slowed down a bit after this. A bit less consuming and driving and flying. I bet it won't though. We'll heat up the planet until we melt.</p>
