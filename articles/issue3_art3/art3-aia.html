 <p><!--come vanno messi due tag insieme?? --><span class="person artist"><b>Dan Roosegaarde</b></span>—artist, designer and futurist—opened his <time datetime="2015">2015</time> talk at the <span class="entity">World Economic Forum</span> in <span class="place">Davos</span>, <span class="place">Switzerland</span>, with a film of undulating waterways, vibrating grasses and a stormy, painterly <!--cosa essere tu coso -->Dutch Golden Age sky. He talked about growing up in <span class="place">Nieuwkoop</span>, <span class="place">Netherlands</span>, and how that memory is still powerfully at the center of his understanding of nature, beauty, himself and his work. But lest we romanticize the scenes before us, he quickly made a factual point. Since one-fourth of the <span class="place">Netherlands</span> is below sea level and 60 percent is susceptible to flooding, what we were seeing was an aquatic engineering wonder, made possible by dikes, dams, wind-driven water pumps (i.e., windmills), canals and floodgates. Technology has controlled Holland’s rivers and kept the sea at bay, thus allowing agriculture and commerce to flourish.</p>

<p>For <span class="artwork"><i>Waterlicht</i></span>, presented at several European locations last year, <span class="person"><span class="artist">Roosegaarde</span> projects blue LED light into urban spaces at night to create a vaporous layer of “water”—a virtual sea at the level the ocean would be were it not restrained. Of course the work is also a cautionary allusion to the height—usually well over human heads—that the water could reach with climate change. (In each case, the level of the projection is determined by the local water board.) Nature, at least in the <span class="place">Netherlands</span>, is a glorious but highly regulated construct.</p>

<p>Context, place, point of origin and their relationship to technology are all crucial to the “techno poetics” of design, as <span class="person"><span class="artist">Roosegaarde</span> calls his approach. <i>Dune</i>, an interactive installation, was the first <span class="person">Roosegaarde</span> piece I encountered live. In a darkened room off the main hall of the <span class="entity">World Economic Forum Conference</span> Center, various dignitaries waved their arms over a fanciful garden of flexible plastic reeds with white LED tips. They were demonstrating what they had just learned from <span class="person artist">Roosegaarde</span>: human interaction could trigger the reeds to light up the room.</p> 

<p>This piece was perfectly suited to such a relatively confined setting, but most of <span class="person artist">Roosegaarde</span>’s work is site-specific to large public spaces—rural and urban—including parks, countryside, walkways, plazas, airports, train stations and highways. At <span class="place">Amsterdam</span>’s main railroad terminal, his <i>Rainbow Station</i> (<time datetime="2014">2014</time>-15), using liquid crystal lenses developed in collaboration with astronomers at the <span class="entity">University of Leiden</span>, separates light into a spectrum and beams it across the tracks, where it takes the shape of the roughly 150-foot-wide station roof. Throughout <time datetime="2015">2015</time>, the “rainbow” appeared nightly at sundown, at an undisclosed moment, to mark both <span class="entity">UNESCO</span>’s International Year of Light and the 125th anniversary of the <span class="place">Amsterdam Central Station</span>.</p> 

<p>In conversation, <span class="person artist">Roosegaarde</span> cites many influences for his work: <!--come vanno due classi?? --><span class="person artist">Buckminster Fuller</span>, <span class="person artist">Marshall McLuhan</span>, <span class="person artist">Leonardo da Vinci</span>, <span class="person artist">Rem Koolhaas</span> and <span class="person artist">Salomon van Ruysdael</span>. Clearly an environmental artist, <span class="person artist">Roosegaarde</span> is also profoundly interested in the <span class="art-movement">Land art movement</span>. He is particularly familiar with the earthwork<span class="artwork"><i>Broken Circle and Spiral Hill</i></span>, which <span class="person artist">Robert Smithson sited in a working sand quarry in <span class="place">Emmen</span>, <span class="place">Netherlands</span>, in <time datetime="1971">1971</time>.</p>

<p>In the <time datetime="1970">1970</time>s, <span class="person artist">Smithson</span>, <span class="person artist">Walter De Maria</span>, <span class="person artist">Michael Heizer</span> and others strove to create a new purity of form. Needing to escape what <span class="person artist">Smithson</span> called the “cultural confinement” of galleries and museums, which these artists felt “neutralized” art-making, they sought something bigger, more dramatic and more immediate. 1 But their work, which came to define site-specificity, was never really public art. It has always been remote and difficult to see, with the exception of such relocated pieces as <span class="person artist">Heizer</span>’s <time datetime="2012">2012</time> <span class="artwork"><i>Levitated Mass</i></span> (a boulder positioned threateningly above a troughlike concrete walkway at the <span class="entity">Los Angeles County Museum of Art</span>). In general, Land art—in works like <span class="person artist">James Turrell</span>’s <span class="artwork"><i>Roden Crater</i></span> (1974-ongoing)—is not just placed <i>in</i> the landscape, it is <i>of</i> the landscape. <span class="person artist">Smithson</span>, for one, did not want to create embellishment. He sought to “recycle” land that had been abandoned or negatively altered, and to transform it into art.2</p>

<p>Operating outside of the gallery system that these artists challenged, <span class="person artist">Roosegaarde</span> has adopted many of their goals and methodologies—such as the use of industrial materials, the emphasis on process, the collaboration with construction companies and large-scale industries, and the direct allusion to nature. But <span class="person artist">Roosegaarde</span> has transcended <span class="person artist">Smithson</span>’s caveat that <q>“utility and art don’t mix”</q> 3 and has demonstrated that good art, like good design, can be extraordinarily beautiful while also addressing real-world problems. <q>“I’m looking for a balance between poetry and pragmatism,”</q> he says, <q>“which I think <i>should</i> be the role of the designer/artist.”</q> 4</p>

<p>In a time when we bemoan the impact of humans on the natural world, <span class="person artist">Roosegaarde</span>’s interventions literally illuminate both the rural and the urban landscape. Many of them exemplify sustainable design, seeking not only to reduce the amount of energy used but also to generate their own energy. He imagines how, like jellyfish, they might light themselves—thus <q>“doing more, instead of less.”</q> 5</p> 

<p>Early in the development of such ideas, <span class="person artist">Roosegaarde</span> and his studio designed <span class="artwork"><i>Sustainable Dance Floor</i></span> (<time datetime="2008">2008</time>). The dancers’ movements, activating embedded sensors, lit up a multicolor platform in the once-popular <span class="place">Club Watt</span> in <span class="place">Rotterdam</span>. In <span class="place">Nuenen</span>, <span class="place">Netherlands</span>, where <span class="person artist">Van Gogh</span> lived for a time, <!-- work o artwork'?--><span class="work"><i>Van Gogh-Roosegaarde Bicycle Path</i></span> accumulates solar energy during the day to energize photovoltaic stones lodged in concrete, which then pattern the pathway with glowing swirls reminiscent of  <span class="artwork"><i>Starry Night</i></span>. This very popular evening bike route opened in November <time datetime="2014">2014</time>, pre-launching last year’s commemoration of <span class="person artist">Van Gogh</span>’s death 125 years ago.</p>

<p><span class="person artist">Roosegaarde</span>’s <span class="work"><i>Smart Highway</i></span> was named Best Future Concept at the <span class="event">Dutch Design Awards</span> in <time datetime="2012">2012</time>. Working with the <span class="entity">Heijmans infrastructure development company</span> in the Dutch province of <span class="place">Noord-Brabant</span> on the Belgian border, <span class="person artist">Roosegaarde</span>—inspired in part by <span class="person artist">Yves Klein</span>, who made his own paint 6 —created a photoluminescent mixture that lights up 150 miles of highway lane lines after dark. The paint is charged by sunlight during the day and by headlights at night (not unlike the glow-in-the-dark stars in children’s bedrooms). The lines radiate green—the color that is easiest to see after sundown—and remain visible for eight hours. Their glow is so bright it could eliminate the need for streetlights.</p>

<p><span class="person artist">Roosegaarde</span>’s multipart <span class="work"><b>“Smog Free Project</b></span>”—perhaps his most complex and utopian undertaking to date—opened in Rotterdam on <time datetime="2015-09-04">Sept. 4, 2015</time>. A white, 23-foot-high, solar-powered vacuum device, resembling an elegantly slatted vertical beehive with panels that open from the top, sucks in pollutants to such a degree that the air in the surrounding area becomes measurably cleaner and healthier to breathe. <span class="person artist">Roosegaarde</span>’s machine, the <span class="work"><i>Smog Free Tower</i></span>, which uses as much energy as a household vacuum cleaner, is dramatic, playful and somewhat extravagant. It is clearly not, in itself, a solution to the world’s pollution problems, but it is an emissary of hope, allowing us to imagine that we could someday remedy the global crisis through an audacious and confident use of technology.</p> 

<p>Many of <span class="person artist">Roosegaarde</span>’s supporters were in attendance at the opening of the <span class="work">“Smog Free Project”</span>: the mayor of <span class="place">Rotterdam</span>, officials from the <span class="place">Port of Rotterdam</span>, art- and business-world collaborators, and personal friends—all interested in environmental concerns; the intersection of art, design and technology; and the future of the city as a center for innovation. Present, too, was a Studio Roosegaarde jewelry artist who was turning the black soot we breathe every day into rings and cufflinks—another component of <span class="person artist">Roosegaarde</span>’s innovative project. The pollutants sucked into the <span class="work">Smog Free Tower</span> are harvested and then compressed to form miniature cubes, which are placed in a setting, trapped in clean air and sealed in acrylic. The sale of these objects (at around $285 each) has allowed <span class="person artist">Roosegaarde</span> to fund the concept without relying on big business branding. With each purchase, customers buy the world 35,000 cubic feet of clean air. Crowdsourcing launched and now sustains the <span class="work">Smog Free Project</span>, and <span class="person artist">Roosegaarde</span> hopes it will also help to create a movement in support of cleaner air. The <span class="work">Smog Free Tower</span> will travel around the world.</p>

<p><span class="person artist">Roosegaarde</span> is an <q>“infiltrator,”</q> he says, <q>“a hippie with a business plan.”</q> 7  His goal is to bring the potential of the future to the present. As <span class="person artist">Smithson</span> once wrote, <q>“What the artist seeks is coherence and order—not ‘truth,’ correct statements, or proofs. He seeks the fiction that reality will sooner or later imitate.”</q> 8</p>

<p><span class="person artist">Roosegaarde</span>’s <span class="work">“Smog Free Project”</span> encourages us to ask: How do we become aware of the dirt we are inhaling every day? How can we clean the air and make it breathable? What is to be learned from nature? Can we turn dross into gold, coal into diamonds, soot into something elegant and crystalline? The questions are both literal and metaphoric, and they demand our engagement. Quoting <span class="person">Marshall McLuhan</span>, <span class="person artist">Roosegaarde</span> reminds us, <q>“There are no passengers on the Spaceship Earth. We are all crew.”</q> 9</p>

<p>For change to occur, humans need to desire what does not yet exist. There could scarcely be a better strategy to achieve this than enabling us to breathe clean air—something simple and primal that reminds us everyday what has been lost, what might be done to reclaim it, and how the imaginative use of technology in concert with the making of art could be central to such a transformation.
