		<p>Saving the planet.</p>

		<p>It’s not just the subject of passionate political debate.</p>

		<p>It’s at the heart of a growing number of museum exhibitions this year, including the works of old masters and exhibits built with high-tech innovations, designed to inspire artistic appreciation and a desire to respond to environmental challenges.</p>

		<p>Among the shows: The much-anticipated <span class="event">“Hudson Rising”</span> at the <span class="entity">New-York Historical Society</span>; <span class="event">“Nature’s Nation: American Art and Environment,”</span> in <span class="place">Salem</span>, <span class="place">Mass</span>., which looks at 300 years of American art through an environmental lens; <span class="event">“Documenting Change: Our Climate (Past, Present and Future)”</span> in <span class="place">Boulder</span>, <span class="place">Colo</span>. And more.</p>

		<p><q>“There’s a crescendo of interest in both art that is itself about the environment and art that is self-consciously environmental, and I think that’s entirely understandable and good, because it draws attention to these dire situations we’re facing,”</q> said <span class="person">Karl Kusserow</span> curator of American Art at the <span class="entity">Princeton University Art Museum</span> .</p> <!--Style come tag per art movements? -->

		<p>Dr. <span class="person">Kusserow</span> is a co-curator of <span class="event">“Nature’s Nation: American Art and Environment,”</span> which includes paintings, artifacts, sculpture, prints, photographs and decorative art. It started at the <span class="entity">Princeton University Art Museum</span> and is now showing at the <span class="entity">Peabody Essex Museum</span> in <span class="place">Salem</span> until <time datetime="05-05">May 5</time>. It will end at the <span class="entity">Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art</span> in <span class="place">Bentonville</span>, <span class="place">Ark</span>., from <time datetime="05-25">May 25</time> to <time datetime="09-09">Sept. 9</time>.</p>

		<p><q>“The impetus grew out of my concern for climate change, and my recognition and realization that I could bridge my concerns as a citizen with my work as a scholar,”</q> said Dr. <span class="person">Kusserow</span>, who spent seven years developing the show with <span class="person">Alan Braddock</span>, associate professor of Art History and American Studies at the <span class="entity">College of William & Mary</span>.</p>

		<p>The goal of the exhibition, he said, is to view famous and lesser-known art through ecological glasses: how the environment is represented in images and how humans’ place in the world is depicted.</p>

		<p><q>“It asks people to think in new ways about iconic works,”</q> Dr. <span class="person">Kusserow</span> said. For example, the famous 19th-century<!-- come mettere i secoli!--> painting by <span class="person artist">Albert Bierstadt</span>, <span class="artwork">“Bridal Veil Falls, Yosemite”</span> — a lush painting of one of the national park’s waterfalls — is hung alongside a work by the artist <span class="person artist">Valerie Hegarty</span> from <time datetime="2007">2007</time>, <span class="artwork">“Fallen Bierstadt,”</span> which shows the same painting askew, burned and ripped.</p>

		<p><q>“<span class="person artist">Bierstadt</span> presents a certain way of understanding nature as beautiful and unpeopled and full of animals and grain and enduring and static, and <span class="person artist">Hegarty</span> takes that same image and literally dematerializes it,”</q> he said.</p>

		<p>Another painting — <span class="artwork">“Prisoners From the Front,”</span>  by  <span class="person artist">Winslow Homer</span>  — is an image traditionally interpreted as a confrontation between a Union officer and Confederate soldiers. But the surrounding landscape looks barren, and the show focuses on the environmental effects of the Civil War on the land, which included deforestation and the burning of crops. It was a strategy of the North and South and <q>“it really had dire environmental consequences,”</q> Dr. <span class="person">Kusserow</span> said.</p>

		<p>The <span class="entity">New-York Historical Society</span>’s major spring show,  <span class="event">“Hudson Rising”</span>  (through <time datetime="08-04">Aug. 4</time>), intertwines famed works of art, as well as aquariums, political leaflets, music and videos.</p>

		<p>The show offers one of the most comprehensive exhibits ever on the Hudson River, with the goal of not simply looking at ecological changes, but understanding how the river <q>“became an incubator for environmental activism,”</q> said <span class="person">Marci Reaven</span>, the museum’s vice president for history exhibitions.</p>

		<p>The exhibition proceeds chronologically and geographically from the <time datetime="1800">1800</time>s and the building of the Erie Canal<!-- che cazzo è un canale--> through today. It displays the beauty of the Hudson through the museum’s extensive collection of <span class="entity">Hudson River School</span> paintings, as well as photographs and tourist memorabilia, such as posters from the <time datetime="1930">1930</time>s encouraging people to take a day trip on the river. But it also shows the toll that tourism and industry have taken.</p>

		<p><q>“All of its uses and passions come into conflict with each other,”</q> Dr. <span class="person">Reaven</span> said. <q>“There is a growing awareness the region may not be able to be all things to all people.”<q></p>

		<p>The show highlights activism over the years to save the Hudson.</p>

		<p>In the early<!--century --> 20th century, organizations such as women’s clubs and preservationist societies protested the rock blasting of the <span class="entity">Palisades cliffs</span> overlooking the river from <span class="place">New Jersey</span> and helped create <!-- entity??-->Palisades Amusement Park, which became one of the most visited in the country.</p>


		<p>In the <time datetime="1960">1960</time>s and <time datetime="1970">1970</time>s activists fought, and ultimately defeated, a plan by <span class="person">Con Edison</span> to build a plant on<!-- place??--> Storm King Mountain on the river’s west bank in <span class="place">New York</span>. Visitors to the exhibition can see a yellow political button with the slogan, <q>“Dig they won’t … Save the Hudson,”</q> and hear the folk singer <span class="person">Pete Seeger</span>’s song <span class="work">“My Dirty Stream,”</span> a mournful ode to the polluted river.</p>

		<p>The end of the exhibition will be a look toward the future and how to reclaim the Hudson River in response to climate change, showcasing projects already underway, such as reeflike structures, known as<!-- definirlo come q?--> “living breakwaters,” that can decrease the impact of waves, and help restore the shoreline.</p>

		<p><q>“The idea is to look at what has been resolved and what are the new challenges,”</q> Dr. <span class="person">Reaven</span> said. <q>“What is the river teaching us, how will climate change unfold in the region and how are people preparing?”</q></p>

		<p> <span class="entity">The University of Colorado Art Museum</span>, </span>using resources at its doorsteps, is showing <span class="event">“Documenting Change: Our Climate (Past, Present and Future)</span>, until <time datetime="07-20">July 20</time>>. It encompasses 70 works of art by 30 artists.</p>

		<p>It includes pieces by <span class="person artist">Tali Weinberg</span>, who incorporates climate change data and drought data into the textiles she weaves, and a four-hour video by <span class="person">Peggy Weil</span>, <span class="work">“88 Cores,”</span> which connects images from 88 ice cores from the nearby <span class="entity">National Science Foundation Ice Core Facility</span>.</p>

		<p><span class="entity">The Climate Museum</span> in <span class="place">New York City</span> will hold an exhibition at its temporary home on <span class="place">Governors Island</span> from <time datetime="05-04">May 4</time> through <time datetime="10-31">Oct. 31</time>. The museum last year installed 10 solar powered traffic signs that looked like digital highway messages, but issued warnings such as <q>“Climate Change at Work.”</q></p>

		<p>From <time datetime="03-16">March 16</time> through <time datetime="06-14">June 14</time>, the museum, in partnership with <!--entity?? -->the New York City Department of Education Office of Sustainability, will present <span class="work">“Climate Speaks,”</span> a training program and competition focused on spoken word and poetry related to climate change and social justice. The finalists will appear at the Apollo Theater in <span class="place">Harlem</span> on <time datetime="06-14">June 14</time>.</p>

		<p>The theme of the <span class="event">Cooper Hewitt Design Triennial</span> is <span class="work">“Nature, ”</span> <!-- Ci sono dei nomi scritti sbagliati -->from <time datetime="05-10">May 10</time> to <time datetime="2020-01-20">Jan. 20, 2020</time>. It will include 62 projects focused on how designers and artists are collaborating with scientists, engineers, environmentalists and others to <q>“find potential solutions — to make steps to save our planet,”</q> said <span class="person">Caroline Baumann</span>, director of the museum. <q>“And I include the ‘make steps’ because some of these are speculative — they are provoking the viewer.”</q></p>

		<p>The show will run simultaneously at the <span class="entity">Cooper Hewitt</span>, the <span class="entity">Smithsonian Design Museum</span> in <span class="place">New York</span> and at the <span class="entity">Cube design museum</span> in <span class="place">Kerkrade</span>, the <span class="place">Netherlands</span>, a first for the <span class="entity">Cooper Hewitt</span>, Ms. <span class="person">Baumann</span> said.</p>

		<p>The show will include a “smell series” by the artist <span class="person artist">Christina Agapakis</span>, the designer <span class="person">Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg</span> and the olfactory artist <span class="person artist">Sissel Tolaas</span> that recreates the aromas of extinct flowers through DNA drawn from specimens preserved at the <span class="entity">Harvard University Herbaria</span>. There will also be an organic cotton burial suit by the designer <span class="person">Jae Rhim Lee, which contains biodegradable materials that also break down toxins in the human body.</p>

		<p>And outdoors will be <span class="work">“Tree of 40 Fruit”</span>  by the artist <span class="person artist">Sam Van Aken</span> — a real tree that has apples, pears, plums, peaches, cherries and apricots grafted on it using century-old methods to preserve rare fruit.</p>

		<p><q>“We’ve got a tremendous desire on the part of scientists to engage with different audiences and a desire on the part of humanists and artists to grapple with the immensity of the problems we’re facing right now,”</q> ” <!--errore battitura? -->said <span class="person">Erin Espelie</span>, co-director of the <span class="entity">Nature, Environment, Science & Technology Studio for the Arts</span> at the <span class="entity">University of Colorado</span>. One way to do that, she added, is through the art museum <q>“bringing people together outside political affiliation and into a different environment that allows for more empathy.”</q></p>
