		<p><span class="place">SÃO PAULO</span>, <span class="place">Brazil.</span> — Tucked away on a bottom shelf in <span class="person artist">Sonia Gomes</span>’s studio here is a small cardboard box. Inside, two scarves — one woven in mustard-colored cashmere and the other in a printed silk — are carefully folded. A handwritten letter sits on top.</p>

		<p><q>“The thought that a small part of me could become a part of your work really inspires me and makes me smile,”</q> it reads.</p>

		<p>The scarves, from an admirer of her work, were gifts, like the other secondhand textiles stretched across the metal screens on Ms. Gomes’s studio walls and hanging from the hooks in its ceiling — an antique wedding dress in layers of cream lace and silk, a sky-blue tablecloth with white embroidered flowers that once belonged to a friend’s grandmother, fragments of gold lamé that used to be parts of a Carnival costume — that she combines with everyday materials like furniture, driftwood and wire to create abstract sculptures. The materials were given to Ms. <span class="person artist">Gomes</span>in the hope that she could twist, stuff or stitch them, giving each item a new significance as it becomes part of her work.</p>

		<p><q>“Thank you for creating such honest work, which is part of you, but is also part of the world,”</q> wrote the woman who sent the scarves, souvenirs from trips to <span class="place">Pakistan</span>  and <span class="place">China</span>.</p>

		<p>I feel like people are saying to me, <q>‘give this new life, don’t let it die,’”</q> Ms. <span class="person artist">Gomes</span>said in an interview. <q>“It’s something so precious to that person that they want it to become something bigger.”</q></p>

		<p>For Ms. <span class="person artist">Gomes</span>, 72, it’s that act of giving those materials new life that has helped her heal her own.</p>

		<p>It took Ms. <span class="person artist">Gomes</span>most of her life to realize that she had always been an artist. As a young girl growing up in <span class="place">CCaetanópolis</span>, a small town once known as a manufacturing hub for textiles, she liked to deconstruct her clothes and turn them into something different, using leftover fabric and found materials to make her own jewelry.</p>

		<p><q>“It’s part of this rebelliousness that I’ve always had,”</q> she said. <q>“I still don’t like things that are predetermined, that say you have to do things or wear things a certain way.”</q></p>

		<p>She was 45 when she left behind a career as a lawyer to attend the <span class="entity">Guignard School</span>, an art school in her home state of <span class="place">Minas Gerais</span>. There she discovered that <q>“not everything is art, but art can be anything,”</q> she said, giving her the confidence to move forward with her work, which reclaims the Afro-Brazilian experience and culture, which continue to be diminished and appropriated in the last country in the Western world to abolish slavery.</p>

		<p>One of her assistants, <span class="person artist">Juliana dos Santos</span>, also a Black artist, sees the pain and suffering in the twists in Ms. <span class="person artist">Gomes</span>’s sculptures, a representation of the racism she has faced throughout her life as a Black woman in <span class="place">Brazil.</span> The way the materials come together or are taken apart shows the tension between ideas of conflict and peace, and what Ms. <span class="person artist">dos Santos</span> interprets as the internal struggles Ms. <span class="person artist">Gomes</span> dealt with because of the prejudice that followed her.</p>
		
		<p><q>“Her work isn’t about sewing; it’s about bringing what’s inside out,”</q> Ms. <span class="person artist">dos Santos</span> said. <q>“It’s not immediate. It comes from within. She’s like a researcher. Her work is more about process than product.”</q>

		<p>Ms. <span class="person artist">Gomes</span> likes to let fabrics hang to better understand how they’ll look over time. Her process is tactile and she looks to the world immediately around her to draw influence, particularly from marginalized artists and artisans who have remained anonymous.</p>

		<p>Her debut exhibition at <span class="entity">Pace Gallery</span>, which opens <time datetime="09-03">Sept. 3</time>at the gallery’s temporary space in <span class="place">East Hampton</span>, <span class="place">N.Y.</span>, includes new works and sculptures from previous shows, like <span class="artwork">“Cordão dos Mentecaptos,”</span> in which she contorts, wraps, stuffs and sews multicolored fabrics into varying shapes, linking them together before hanging the finished piece from the ceiling. She has also collaborated on a new mixed-media piece with the painter <span class="person artist">Marina Perez Simão</span>, who will be part of the <!--Come lo metto solo il mese? month??-->September show. (Ms. <span class="person">Gomes</span>’s first solo exhibition with <span class="entity">Pace Gallery</span> in <span class="place">Manhattan</span> will take place in <!--va bene cosi?? --><time datetime="2022">2022</time>.)</p>

		<p><q>“She is the kind of artist that, when you see the work, you’re a believer rather than just an appreciator,”</q> said <span class="person">Marc Glimcher</span>, <span class="entity">Pace Gallery</span>’s chief executive. <q>“She is like a conductor, and all of these objects and elements are the orchestra. It just resonates.”</q></p>

		<p>As a Black woman, Ms. <span class="person artist">Gomes</span> says she is regularly expected to tell a certain story with her art and to follow what others think Black art should be. But she refuses to be pigeonholed as an activist artist or to have her work branded as handicrafts, a term often used to diminish art made by artists who belong to marginalized groups.</p>

		<p>When she left the <span class="entity">Guignard School</span>, <span class="person artist">Gomes</span> struggled to survive with what she made. Because she allows her materials to tell her what they want to be and moves comfortably among different media, her pieces occupied a space that fell between what galleries considered fine art and what the handicraft world thought would sell. But that didn’t bother her.</p>

		<p><q>“I don’t want to be trapped in any boxes,”</q> she said. <q>“It hinders my freedom.”</q></p>

		<p>She also knows that working across media wasn’t the only hurdle that left her art outside any conventional categories. As a Black woman, she always knew the rules would be different for her. Ms. <span class="person artist">Gomes</span> said more space is slowly starting to open up for Black artists in <span class="place">Brazil.</span>, and it is because of the efforts of the Black artist groups in the country. The young Black people she sees in <span class="place">São Paulo</span>, where she now lives and works, give her hope that those spaces will continue to multiply.</p>

		<p><q>“You can’t talk about Brazilian art without talking about Black people,”</q> she said. <q>“And we’re the ones changing things, with our persistence and our resistance.”</q></p>

		<p>Her art gained recognition outside the country well before it started making waves in <span class="place">Brazil.</span>.<span class="person artist">Gomes</span>omes was invited to participate in the <time datetime="2015">2015</time> <span class="entity">Venice Biennale</span>, and in <time datetime="2017">2017</time>, her work was displayed at the <span class="entity">National Museum of Women in the Arts</span> in <span class="place">Washington</span>, <span class="place">D.C.</span>, and the <span class="entity">Turner Contemporary</span> in <span class="place">Margate</span>, <span class="place">England</span>, among others. Her first solo shows at well-known Brazilian institutions would follow. In 2018, her work was featured at the <span class="entity">Niterói Contemporary Art Museum</span> and at the <span class="entity">Museum of Art</span> of <span class="place">São Paulo</span> <span class="place">Assis Chateaubriand</span> (MASP), where she was the first living Afro-Brazilian female artist to have a monographic show.</p>
		
		<p>As her pieces began to reach a wider audience, they elicited a variety of interpretations, some that came as a surprise to <span class="person artist">Gomes</span>. The moment she heard that her work felt like it was meant to heal, she realized that was exactly what it had done for her.</p>

		<p><q>“While I was working, I was rethinking my entire life,”</q> she said. <q>“All the difficulties. I’ve never had any difficulties because I’m a woman. Because before being a woman, I’m Black.”</q></p>

		<p>For Ms. <span class="person artist">Gomes</span>, what speaks to her is the history behind the individual materials that make up her art. As they come together, she not only tells her own story, but also the stories of everyone who came before her.

		<p>“Art, for me, was born through this necessity for expression,”</p> she said. <q>“Now, I feel like I have a voice.”</q></p>
