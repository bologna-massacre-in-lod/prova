		<p>In times of adversity, we look to art to give form to chaos. But where do you go when the chaos keeps you from art entirely? It will have to be online. As the coronavirus pandemic stretches into yet another month, keeping arts institutions closed across the globe, museums’ websites are now posting traffic numbers that were once unimaginable.</p>

		<p>The <span class="entity">Musée du Louvre</span> in <span class="place">Paris</span> has reported a tenfold increase in web traffic, from 40,000 to 400,000 visitors per day. Visits to the websites of the <span class="entity">National Gallery of Art</span> in <span class="place">Washington</span> and the <span class="entity">Courtauld Institute of Art</span> in <span class="place">London</span> are also up by huge multiples. Audiences are seeking out arts material for children &#8212; the <span class="entity">Metropolitan Museum of Art</span> reports an elevenfold uptick to #MetKids, its youth education initiative. Remember just a decade ago, when the <span class="entity">Met</span> raised hackles, within and beyond its walls, for its ambitious digitization initiative, as if it were dangerous to offer more than 400,000 high-resolution, free-to-download images of the collection? No one’s saying that now.</p>

		<p>Should a museum aim to replicate online the exact experience of visiting in person the world’s great picture galleries and palaces? They’ve been trying for two decades, and the pictures have certainly gotten crisper. In too many cases, virtual museum walk-throughs remain unwieldy, with herky-jerky navigation. Often information is out of date. And there’s no coffee!</p>

		<p>The truth is that a museum’s digital assets can’t duplicate its brick-and-mortar presence &#8212; and the best of them, the ones I’ve selected here, do not try. Rather, they regard a museum’s physical and digital activities as complementary platforms of a single mission. They take the ambition and intelligence and public commitment they bring to the galleries, and feed it into new channels onscreen.</p>

		<h2><span class="entity">GOOGLE ARTS &amp; CULTURE</span></h2>

		<h3>You Are There, for a Minute</h3>

		<figure>

		</figure>

		<p>When cultural institutions shut in <span class="place">China</span>, then <span class="place">Italy</span>, and then the rest of the world, museum boosters blew the dust off a digital project some of us had forgotten: <span class="entity">Google’s Arts &amp; Culture<span class="entity"> initiative, which promises virtual experiences of the world’s great galleries with the same 360-degree views familiar from its Maps application. (The effort is not wholly altruistic: <span class="entity">Google</span>’s culture division, based in <span class="place">Paris</span> and part of a nonprofit arm of its parent, <span class="entity">Alphabet</span>, constitutes a big part of a major <q>soft lobbying</q> effort to endear the search giant to European antitrust regulators.)</p>

		<p><span class="entity">Google</span> has since partnered with hundreds of new institutions, notably in <span class="place">Asia</span>, and now you can toggle from the <span class="entity">British Museum</span> to the <span class="entity">Sydney Opera House</span> with the flick of a browser tab. It had been a while since I’d explored <span class="entity">Google</span>’s museum walk-throughs, and they remain a poor cousin of a real museum visit. <span class="entity">The Hermitage</span> in <span class="place">St. Petersburg</span> appears blown out by an atomic flash, its collection of <span class="artwork">Rembrandts</span> as grainy as an Etch A Sketch. The walk-throughs can also be years out of date: <span class="entity">Google</span>’s record of the <span class="entity">Musée d’Orsay</span>’s <span class="art-movement">Impressionist</span> collection looks nothing like it did when I last visited in <time datetime="2019-12">December</time>.</p>

		<p>Really, you don’t fire these up to scrutinize art. You do it for the same reason I procrastinate by dropping the little yellow guy in random spots on <span class="entity">Google Street View</span>: for a quick, moderately pleasant immersion, one that allows you to think, at least for a minute or so, <q>I am there.</q></p>

		<p>With <span class="entity">Google</span>, therefore, concentrate on museums whose architecture tends to visual splendor, like the <span class="place">S&atilde;o Paulo</span> <span class="entity">Museum of Art</span>, whose painting collection hangs on free-standing glass easels designed by the great Brazilian architect <span class="person artist">Lina Bo Bardi</span>. Or <span class="place">Berlin</span>&rsquo;s <span class="entity">Neues Museum</span>, housed in a bombed-out Neoclassical structure renovated by <span class="person artist">David Chipperfield</span>: the gashed walls and half-repainted frescoes are a delight, even if the Egyptian antiquities are barely visible. And since surroundings have the upper hand over individual works, <span class="entity">Google</span>’s app is also ideal for a brief gambol through world heritage sites, like the <span class="place">Palace of Versailles</span> or <span class="place">Delhi</span>’s <span class="place">Red Fort</span>, the main residence of the Mughal emperors.</p>

		<h2>MUSEUM WEBSITES</h2>

		<h3>Unseen Gems of a Collection</h3>

		</figure>

		<p>A few historical museums have built robust virtual walk-throughs of their own &#8212; above all the <span class="entity">Palace Museum</span> in <span class="place">Beijing</span>, whose website and app allow you to explore the galleries and residences of the <span class="place">Forbidden City</span> in very high definition. (The site has an English interface, but information on individual objects is only in Chinese.) The <span class="entity">Vatican Museums</span>’ site has sufficient, if not mind-blowing, immersive views of the <span class="place">Sistine Chapel</span> and <span class="place"><span class="person artist">Raphael</span>’s Rooms</span>, while the <span class="entity">Zacheta National Gallery of Art</span> in <span class="place">Warsaw</span> has some of the highest-definition renderings I’ve seen of current contemporary museum exhibitions.</p>

		<p>For kids, the site Muséosphère offers 360-degree tours of the lushest rooms in 13 of <span class="place">Paris</span>’s municipal museums, including the <span class="entity">Musée de la Vie Romantique</span> and <span class="entity">Musée Carnavalet</span>. The <span class="entity">Uffizi</span> in <span class="place">Florence</span> has just started its own virtual tour (of higher quality than the one <span class="entity">Google</span> hosts), and the <span class="entity">Louvre</span> offers a 360-degree walk-through of its <span class="place">Petite Galerie</span>, a space for families and students.</p>

		<p>But the smartest museums are thinking beyond the <q>virtual visit.</q> Since the coronavirus outbreak, the best on-the-fly digital exhibition conversions I’ve yet seen come from <span class="place">Estonia</span> &#8212; the world leader of high-tech living and governance, where the <span class="entity">Tallinn Art Hall</span> has revamped its entire spring program for the web. Instead of dubiously <q>interactive</q> 360-degree views, <span class="entity">Tallinn Art Hall</span> has produced high-resolution video walk-throughs shot from fixed positions, within which you can click any object to pause the pan and scrutinize each sculpture or print.</p>

		<p>It was once hard for museums, many of them small nonprofits, to keep pace with digital technology. A good number splurged on virtual displays programmed in Flash and other now disfavored protocols; others saw the web only as a marketing tool for the <q>real</q> museum offline. But costs have dropped, software has gone open-source, and several museums &#8212; like the <span class="entity">Walters Art Museum</span> in <span class="place">Baltimore</span>, the <span class="entity">National Galleries of <span class="place">Scotland</span></span> in <span class="place">Edinburgh</span>, and especially the <span class="entity">Rijksmuseum</span> in <span class="place">Amsterdam</span> &#8212; have made huge strides in collection display.</p>

		<p>These museums now provide high-definition pictures not only of their prized masterpieces, but of the strange and revealing outliers that were once shut up in storage. They offer multiple ways into a collection beyond the curators’ taxonomies, and even let you organize works of art yourself. (The <span class="entity">Rijksmuseum</span> and the <span class="entity">Walters</span>, like more and more museums, offer these high-resolution images in <q>open access,</q> that is, with no copyright restrictions.)</p>

		</figure>

		<p>High-resolution JPGs have transformed the ethos of a museum like the <span class="entity">Barnes Foundation</span> in <span class="place">Philadelphia</span>, which was once so technophobic it didn’t even allow color photography in catalogs. Now its digital collection allows you to pull individual works out of the museum’s idiosyncratic ensembles, and to mix and match at your pleasure.</p>

		<p>Because art is not just what’s on a museum’s walls. <q>Art</q> is a whole collection of experiences and ideas and principles, and a museum’s digital and physical programming have to operate as coequals. The museum that understands this most fully is the <span class="entity">Walker Art Center</span>, in <span class="place">Minneapolis</span>, which a decade ago rolled out the most aggressive and accessible websites of any American museum. The site is a networked treasure house, where its collection and exhibition displays mingle with a panoply of artistic and art-related content, like the Walker Reader, an editorial arm of the museum that features debates on <span class="art-movement">Indigenous art</span>, or on how museums respond to the #MeToo movement.</p>

		<p>Treating the digital museum as coequal to the physical museum means you can be nimble when disaster strikes, and the <span class="entity">Walker</span> has already published pandemic-related articles and curated new video displays and playlists. Similarly nimble institutions include the <span class="entity">Wellcome Collection</span>, in <span class="place">London</span>, which has curated a fascinating digital display of quarantine imagery across the centuries.</p>

		<p>Finally, the <span class="entity">Henie Onstad Kunstsenter<span class="entity"> outside of <span class="place">Oslo</span>, one of the smartest museums in <span class="place">Europe</span>, needed just two weeks to introduce a whole new website that showcases both virtual exhibition walk-throughs and decades of performances. Each week brings new footage: up soon are a <time datetime="1982">1982</time> performance by <span class="person artist">Joseph Beuys</span> and a <time datetime="1990">1990</time> concert by <span class="person artist">Yoko Ono</span>.</p>

		<h2>STREAMING VIDEO</h2>
		<H3>Concerts, Confabs and Curators’ Cocktails</H3>

		<P>What the <span class="entity">Henie Onstad</span> and the <span class="entity">Tallinn Art Hall</span> have figured out is that there is already a killer app for museums: video. High-resolution or low, robustly linked to collection information or tossed off from a smartphone, video has offered us homebound museum-goers a view of art that’s not just more intelligent and more culturally significant than 360-degree immersion, but also a lot cheaper.</p>

		<p>No museum has used streaming video more ambitiously than the <span class="entity">Louisiana Museum of Modern Art<span class="entity">, in the suburbs of <span class="place">Copenhagen</span>, whose <q>Louisiana Channel</q> on <span class="social-network">YouTube</span> has racked up more than 100,000 subscribers who can discover interviews, readings and performances by artists, authors and scientists (almost all in English). Many videos complement the museum’s brick-and-mortar programming: the artists <span class="person artist">Laurie Anderson</span>, <span class="person artist">Hiroshi Sugimoto</span>, <span class="person artist">Rachel Rose</span> and <span class="person">Trevor Paglen</span>, each participated in the <span class="entity">Louisiana</span>'s grand <time datetime="2018">2018</time> exhibition <q>The Moon</q> and spoke to the camera about the art of lunar exploration. But the <span class="entity">Louisiana</span> understands <span class="social-network">YouTube</span> as much more than a promotional tool; it’s a presentation format in its own right, with room for the author <span class="person">Colm Toibin</span> (riffing on a sculpture by <span class="person artist">Giacometti</span>), the architect <span class="person artist">Balkrishna Doshi</span> (on the evolution of architecture in <span class="place">India</span>), and the musician <span class="person artist">Brian Eno</span> (conducting a public singalong of <q>Cotton Fields</q>). They can speak formally or informally, about the collection or their own work, at length or in snippets.</p>

		<!-- qui ci sarebbe un video -->

		<p>The <span class="entity">Art Gallery of New South Wales</span>, <span class="place">Sydney</span>’s major art museum, has made a fast and impressive pivot to <span class="social-network">YouTube</span> since the coronavirus shutdown &#8212; flooding the social network with drawing lessons, mini-lectures, exhibition tours, and concerts that give the museum a new, global public face. The <span class="entity">Pinacoteca di Brera</span>, which has the best painting collection in hard-hit <span class="place">Milan</span>, has produced more than five dozen videos in the last month: short, not always with high production values, but offering immediate confirmation that the work of the museum goes on.</p>

		<p>The best museum experiences online recognize that different formats can have different tones and styles. Yes, a collection database should be as hi-res and authoritative as possible. But new programming in a time of crisis can and should be less polished, more reactive, more intimate, more urgent.</p>

		<p>At the <span class="entity">Stedelijk Museum</span> <span class="place">Amsterdam</span>, the director <span class="person">Rein Wolfs</span> has been walking through the collection galleries with a single cameraphone, riffing on paintings by <span class="person artist">Kokoschka</span> or <span class="person artist">Newman</span> as if he were talking to a friend. The <span class="entity">Frick Collection</span>’s Friday-evening <q>Cocktails With a Curator</q> series remotely pairs short lectures on <span class="person artist">Bellini</span>, <span class="person artist">Bronzino</span> or <span class="person artist">Holbein</span> with drink recommendations (Polish vodka for <span class="person artist">Rembrandt</span>’s <q><span class="artwork">Polish Rider</span></q>). The <span class="entity">J. Paul Getty Museum</span>, in <span class="place">Los Angeles</span>, tossed off nearly a dozen poignant <span class="social-network">Facebook</span> videos under the title <q>Last Minute Michelangelo</q> in the last hours before the staff left the museum. Even the once oracular <span class="entity">Museum of Modern Art</span> now lets its director, <span class="person">Glenn D. Lowry</span>, kibitz with curators on Zoom, just like the rest of us working from home.</p>

		<p>Today, some museums in <span class="place">China</span> have reopened, and in <time datetime="2020-05">May</time>, <span class="place">Germany</span> and other countries where infections have waned will follow. American ones may be closed for months more, and are already facing extreme budget shortfalls. If this crisis teaches them that digital programming cannot be neglected, it might also instruct them about the accomplishments that can come from necessity. Throw away your VR dreams, spend $100 on a microphone and a gimbal, hit the record button on your smartphone, and speak directly to us.</p>
