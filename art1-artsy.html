		<section id="Introduction">
			<p>Since the viral outbreak of COVID-19 in <span class="place">China</span> in <time datetime="2020-01">January</time>, the art world has come to a sudden halt. With major museums, fairs, and galleries canceling events and exhibitions all over the world, the industry as a whole is experiencing the strain of the global pandemic. However, it is easy to forget how the gallery ecosystem in <span class="place">China</span> felt the first, immediate impacts of COVID-19.</p>
			<p><span class="entity">Art Basel</span> in <span class="place">Hong Kong</span>, arguably the biggest art world event in <span class="place">Asia</span>, was set to open to VIPs on <time datetime="2020-03-18">March 18th</time>. When the fair was canceled early last month, it was the first major industry event to be stricken from the calendar &#8212; sending reverberations through the country and the art market at large.</p>
			<span class="entity">Artsy</span> spoke to over 20 galleries in order to examine how the gallery ecosystem has been altered by COVID-19 and how many dealers are coping with the impact the virus has made on the art industry in <span class="place">China</span>.</p>

			<h2>The cancellation of <span class="entity">Art Basel</span> in <span class="place">Hong Kong</span></h2>

			<p>On <time datetime="2020-01-16">January 16th</time>, 24 galleries &#8212; including <span class="entity">Lévy Gorvy</span>, <span class="entity">Lisson Gallery</span>, and <span class="entity">Sprüth Magers</span> &#8212; co-signed a letter that petitioned <span class="entity">Art Basel</span> in <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> to take into account the impact the city’s months-long pro-democracy protests were having on market confidence. Hong Kong’s economy went into a recession last fall tied to the ongoing protests, and in <time datetime="2019-10">October 2019</time>, the <span class="event">Asia Contemporary Art Show</span> canceled its spring 2020 edition due to a decline in attendance and sales at its fall edition. The 24 galleries wanted <span class="entity">Art Basel</span> to make concessions on costs for participating exhibitors. At around the same time, a dozen galleries decided to pull out of the fair entirely, as the spread of COVID-19 became a global concern.</p>
			<p>After the virus was first identified in the beginning of 2020, reports of cases in <span class="place">China</span>, throughout <span class="place">Asia</span>, and then <span class="place">Europe</span> and the <span class="place">United States</span> began to increase. On <time datetime="2020-01-23">January 23rd</time>, the entire Chinese city of <span class="place">Wuhan</span> was placed under lockdown, and <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> confirmed its first COVID-19 case. Mass protest activities in <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> have been suspended ever since.</p>

			<p>Between news of COVID-19 and lingering distress from the protests, the majority of those petitioning the fair to cancel were Western galleries. For international galleries with multiple spaces around the world, <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> makes up a small piece of their business. The prospect of showing at a fair with a lowered turnout of collectors was clearly a losing venture for dealers. Faced with a choice, those galleries would have rather eaten the sunk cost and turned their attention towards other markets.</p>
			<p>But for many regional galleries, <span class="entity">Art Basel</span> in <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> is the most important fair of the year. The cancellation always had the potential to affect local <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> galleries the most, which explains why in the midst of demands to cancel, some local galleries called for the fair to go on. On <time datetime="2020-01-31">January 31st</time>, the board of the <span class="entity">Hong Kong Art Gallery Association</span>, whose members consist of over 40 local and international galleries, released an open letter that expressed how the situation in <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> had been misrepresented to galleries overseas and urged the organizers to consider input from participants other than international galleries.</p>			

			<blockquote>Of course, we can anticipate some effects on the art market, but like SARS in <time datetime="2003">2003</time>, we are confident <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> will bounce back and remain the leading arts hub in <span class="place">Asia</span>.</blockquote>

			<p>However, at the end of the day, COVID-19 presented a public health crisis that concerned not only those in <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> and <span class="place">China</span>, but internationally, as well. Regardless of the specific reasons that eventually drove the actual cancellation, on <time datetime="2020-02-06">February 6th</time>, <span class="entity">Art Basel</span> announced that the <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> fair would be canceled.</p>
			<p><span class="person">Wei-Wei Wang</span>, the <span class="place">Asia</span> representative for the <span class="place">Zurich</span>-based gallery <span class="entity">Mai 36 Galerie</span>, understood why the fair had to be canceled. <q>As a gallery that has been participating in <span class="entity">Art Basel</span> in <span class="place">Basel</span> for 30 years, we encountered a similar situation in the ’90s during the <span class="event">Gulf War</span>,</q> she said. <q>At the time, the whole show was deserted and there were very few visitors. In the end, [<span class="entity">Art Basel</span> didn’t] have a choice, and we support their decision.</q></p>

			<p>Beyond <span class="entity">Art Basel</span> in <span class="place">Hong Kong</span>, a series of additional large-scale events during the city’s major art season in <time datetime="2020-03">March</time> were also canceled or postponed: <span class="event">Art Central</span>, <span class="event">Hong Kong Arts Festival</span>, museum exhibitions, and a slate of music and dance concerts featuring both local and international performers.</p>
			<p>Despite those cancellations, a cluster of galleries in the <span class="place">Wong Chuk Hang</span> area of the city, such as <span class="entity">Axel Vervoordt Gallery</span>, <span class="entity">Rossi & Rossi</span>, <span class="entity">Pekin Fine Arts</span>, and <span class="entity">Blindspot Gallery</span>, united in solidarity to open their new shows on <time datetime="2020-02-15">February 15th</time>.</p>

			<p><q>During the hardships and challenges like this, it’s great to see the solidarity of the community here,</q> said <span class="person">Boris Vervoordt</span>, founder and director of <span class="entity">Axel Vervoordt Gallery</span>. The gallery also has a space in <span class="place">Antwerp</span>.</p>
			<p>Moreover, almost 70 <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> art and culture organizations&#8212;galleries, museums, auction houses, and universities&#8212;have joined forces to launch the nonprofit <span class="entity">ART Power HK</span>, an online platform to showcase events and exhibitions that were planned for <time datetime="2020-03">this month</time>. The <span class="entity">Asia Society</span> and the <span class="entity">Hong Kong Art Gallery Association</span> have also partnered to put on a month-long sculpture exhibition that is set to open on <time datetime="2020-03-26">March 26th</time>. The exhibition will include works from 21 local and international galleries.</p>
			<p>But the epidemic’s impact on galleries will extend well beyond <time datetime="2020-03">March</time> and <time datetime="2020-04">April</time>. The <span class="entity">Fine Arts Literature Art Center</span>, located in <span class="place">Wuhan</span> at the center of the pandemic, delayed its planned gallery opening and made adjustments to its exhibition programming for the first half of <time datetime="2020">2020</time>.</p>

			<p>As the world’s priority has become combatting the virus &#8212; with entire countries, like <span class="place">Italy</span>, and cities, like <span class="place">Wuhan</span>, remaining under lockdown &#8212; it seems increasingly impossible for society to resume business as usual in the coming months.</p>
			<p><q>A lot of us in the local <span class="place">Wuhan</span> art circle have been working hard at things like transporting supplies to hospitals or fundraising donations through charity auctions,</q> said <span class="person">Liu Ming</span>, founder and director of the <span class="entity">Fine Arts Literature Art Center</span>.</p>
			
			<blockquote><q>During the hardships and challenges like this, it’s great to see the solidarity of the community here.</q></blockquote>

			<p>Because of the pandemic, the center has shifted the priorities of its gallery accordingly. <q>Since its founding, <span class="entity">Fine Arts Literature Art Center</span> has been juggling media and nonprofit projects,</q> said <span class="person">Ming</span>. <q>We have a large collection of books, documents, and materials in our warehouse and archives. During this time, we will concentrate on organizing and researching these materials, as well as planning online activities.</q></p>
			<p>All galleries in mainland <span class="place">China</span> and <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> have been set back in one way or another, which has made many in the industry anxious. <q>We are all in a state of feeling tense,</q> said <span class="person">Chao Lu</span>, director at the <span class="place">Beijing</span> location of <span class="entity">Chambers Fine Art</span>. As public events have been canceled and regular business activities have come to a standstill in <span class="place">Beijing</span>, the gallery might focus on its presence in other markets.</p>

			<p><span class="entity">Galleria Continua</span>, which recently opened its fifth location in <span class="place">Rome</span> in addition to spaces in <span class="place">San Gimignano</span>, <span class="place">Beijing</span>, <span class="place">Moulins</span>, and <span class="place">Havana</span>, has also felt the virus’s impact on its business. <q>The biggest impact [is that] it reduced contact and interaction within the industry,</q> said <span class="person">Jinle Shi</span>, <span class="entity">Galleria Continua</span>’s <span class="place">Beijing</span> sales manager. <q>For galleries, the direct loss is the loss of connections to clients.</q></p>

			<p><span class="person">David Tung</span>, a director at <span class="entity">Lisson Gallery</span>, said that at the moment, the priority at its <span class="place">Shanghai</span> space is to ensure <q>the safety of our staff and artists, as well as our customers and audience,</q> and to <q>follow the protocols set out by the national and local government and work to defeat this virus.</q></p>
			<p>At the same time, he keeps his clients abreast of the gallery’s updates through the internet. <q>The <span class="place">Shanghai</span> space’s purpose is to better serve our mainland <span class="place">China</span> customers and to take <span class="place">Shanghai</span> as the center, extending to other parts of <span class="place">Asia</span>,</q> <span class="person">Tung</span> said. <q>For us, the function of the <span class="place">Shanghai</span> space during this period remains exactly the same and even allows us to provide better service for our clients.</q></p>

			<blockquote><q>A lot of us in the local <span class="place">Wuhan</span> art circle have been working hard at things like transporting supplies to hospitals or fundraising donations through charity auctions.</q></blockquote>


			<p>International galleries without a physical space in <span class="place">Asia</span>, but which have representatives on the ground, confront their own set of challenges. Sales at these galleries &#8212; such as <span class="entity">Mai 36</span>, <span class="entity">Salon 94</span>, <span class="entity">Pilar Corrias</span>, and <span class="entity">David Kordansky</span>, among others &#8212; rely overwhelmingly on their participation in regional fairs such as <span class="entity">Art Basel</span> in <span class="place">Hong Kong</span>.</p>
			<p><q><span class="event">Art Basel</span> <span class="place">Hong Kong</span>, <span class="event">Gallery Weekend</span> <span class="place">Beijing</span>, and <span class="event">West Bund</span> <span class="place">Shanghai</span> are the few shows where <span class="entity">Mai 36</span> exhibits our artists’ works in <span class="place">Asia</span>,</q> Wei-Wei Wang said. <q><span class="entity">Mai 36</span> has also initiated the exchange program between <span class="event">Gallery Weekend</span> <span class="place">Beijing</span> and <span class="place">Zurich</span> <span class="event">Gallery Weekend</span>. Before the opening of our permanent space, these shows are very important showcase platforms for us.</q></p>
			<p>For the rest of the first half of <time datetime="2020">2020</time>, the gallery will focus its energy on shows outside of <span class="place">Asia</span> that will go on as planned. It has no other plans to show in <span class="place">Asia</span> since <span class="entity">Art Basel</span> in <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> was canceled.</p>

			<p>The epidemic has increased the strain on galleries that have felt the effects of a slowing brick-and-mortar economy. Whether or not it is part of their active strategy, galleries must now devote more energy to their digital platforms.</p>
			<p>The powerhouses have already been focused on online strategy. <span class="entity">Gagosian</span> started making digital sales at the end of <time datetime="2018">2018</time>, with an online showroom that operates alongside the gallery’s presence at annual art fairs. Despite the temporary closing of its <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> space, <span class="entity">Gagosian</span> has increased promoting buying and selling online through frequent updates on its <span class="social-network">WeChat</span> account and other social media platforms.</p>
			<p>On <time datetime="2020-02-11">February 11th</time>, <span class="entity">Hauser & Wirth</span> announced on its <span class="social-network">WeChat</span> channel that the gallery’s <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> space would postpone its <time datetime="2020-03">March</time> exhibition, while opening a brand-new online viewing room in the meantime. The online viewing room would present past exhibitions at its <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> space and new commissions by its artists.</p>

			<blockquote>To keep up with the rapid market changes in this new decade, galleries can no longer solely depend on physical showrooms and art fairs for sales.</blockquote>

			<p>Even though <span class="entity">Art Basel</span> in <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> will not physically take place this year, the fair and its participating galleries have moved online as well. Last week, <span class="entity">Art Basel</span> announced the galleries who will be showcasing works through its new viewing rooms digital initiative, including local dealers like <span class="entity">10 Chancery Lane</span>. <span class="entity">Art Central</span>, too, is bringing sales online for its participating galleries. (Full disclosure: <span class="entity">Artsy</span> is partnering with <span class="entity">Art Central</span> and will be serving as the platform for its online sales.)</p>
			<p>More galleries will utilize third-party online art sales platforms (including those such as <span class="entity">Artsy</span>) to reach a wider community of collectors. It goes without saying that there are advantages to a gallery space in real life, but to keep up with the rapid market changes in this new decade, galleries can no longer solely depend on physical showrooms and art fairs for sales. Unlike physical galleries, buying and selling art online is not bound by geography, and it can happen around the clock.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, it is impossible for the virtual to truly replace the brick-and-mortar experience. Many in the industry are trying to strike a balance between the two. <q>Buying and selling online is definitely a trend, but the physical gallery can’t be replaced, because art itself requires a certain intimacy and looking up close,</q> <span class="person">Ming Liu</span> said. <q>But we do have collaborations and experiments on the online front.</q></p>

			</figure>
			
			<p><span class="person">Chao Lu</span> echoed that sentiment. <q>Even though the art market is putting more and more emphasis on regional fairs, the physical galleries in mainland <span class="place">China</span>, big or small, are still integral,</q> he said. <q>Combining online and offline sales may be the most practical approach to the business. Most clients still prefer to see the works for themselves, even if they are already familiar with the artists’ history and past works.</q></p>
			<p><span class="person">Emerald Mou</span> from <span class="place">Hong Kong</span>–based gallery <span class="entity">Mine Project</span> said, <q>We are passionate about any channels that could help promote young artists. Many of the artists we work with are exploring the internet and how the internet affects our contemporary world, so naturally, the gallery cares about and is active in fields that relate to the internet, whether they are directly connected to digital sales or not.</q></p>
			<p>There have been more than a few enterprises that are trying to capture a piece of the digital art sales market, but the challenges of popularizing art collecting, building platform users, and cultivating online collecting habits might be more difficult to solve than the technology alone.</p>

			<h2>The outlook for the Chinese market</h2>

			</figure>

			<p>While no one has the answer, the question on everyone’s mind in the art world remains: When will the market recover from the effects of COVID-19?</p>
			<p>Of course, it depends on how quickly the pandemic will be contained, and despite the industry’s optimism about the speed of return to normalcy in society, it will take a lot more time for the market to bounce back.</p>
			<p><q>I have confidence that the Chinese government and global efforts will quell the disease, but the repercussions of this will last at least till the fall,</q> said <span class="person">Mathieu Borysevicz</span>, founder and director of <span class="place">Shanghai</span>-based gallery <span class="entity">Bank</span>. <q>The Chinese art market was already sluggish the past two years. This outbreak will only adversely affect anyone doing business in or with <span class="place">China</span> and subsequently the art market. The art market only flourishes when the economy at large does. I think it’ll take at least half a year to recover.</q></p>
			<p>Others are more optimistic, such as <span class="person">Dominique de Villepin</span> and <span class="person">Arthur de Villepin</span>. The two are planning to open their first space in <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> on <time datetime="2020-03-20">March 20th</time>, even amidst the fear and concerns over COVID-19. <q>Over the past several months, <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> has experienced significant political upheaval and is now faced with a serious global health concern,<q> the <span class="person">de Villepins</span> told <span class="entity">Artsy</span>. "Of course, we can anticipate some effects on the art market, but like SARS in <time datetime="2003">2003</time>, we are confident <span class="place">Hong Kong</span> will bounce back and remain the leading arts hub in <span class="place">Asia</span>."</p>

			<p><q>It’s not only the art industry, but our entire society is facing an enormous challenge. The global economy will most likely be affected and it is still early for us to predict its consequences,</q> <span class="person">Wang</span> said. <q>In the face of a matter of life and death, many artists are also reflecting deeper on the question of existence. These are the invisible but positive aspects of what is happening right now.</q></p>
			<p>While the <q>live</q> aspect of art has been interrupted, most would agree that it is an opportunity to reflect on the present and the future of the industry.</p>
			<p><q>While large-scale events do bring attention and large audiences, the focus on these over the past few years had taken us further away from the essence of art,</q> <span class="person">David Tung</span> said. <q>In this sense, I don’t take slowdown in large-scale events as a negative... It is actually an opportunity for us to quietly think about the future development of the art industry in <span class="place">China</span>.</q></p>
